<h1>JACK STRAW IN MEXICO</h1>

<h2 id="CHAPTER_I">CHAPTER I<br />
<span class="smaller">JACK STRAW’S MISSION TO MEXICO</span></h2>

<p>Five members of the “D” club had gathered
in Jack Straw’s room on the top floor
of Phillip’s Hall the last Saturday afternoon
before the end of the Spring term. They had
not assembled in official conclave, indeed they
had not intended to assemble at all. They had
merely gravitated there one by one in search
of something to take their minds off the worst
disappointment they had been compelled to
face that year. The Drueryville-Seaton baseball
game, the one that was to have settled the
preparatory school championship of Vermont,
had been scheduled for that Saturday afternoon,
and, lo and behold, in spite of the importance
of the day, Jupiter Pluvius or whoever
it was that controlled the rain supply,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_2" id="Page_2">[2]</a></span>
had made the game impossible by deluging
everything in sight since early morning. And
there was no chance of postponing the contest
either as school closed the following Friday.
The championship would have to remain undecided.
And this was just the year Drueryville
stood a better chance than ever of adding the
“prep” cup to her trophy case. It was enough
to make anyone glum.</p>

<p>“They should have named this place Drearyville
instead of Drueryville,” muttered Toad
Fletcher, the stocky little catcher of the team,
as he looked across the deserted campus at the
dripping eves of Bradley Hall.</p>

<p>John Monroe Strawbridge, who was known
to every boy in school as Jack Straw, shifted
his position on the window seat so that he
could take another look at the weather.</p>

<p>“It is pretty gloomy on a day like this,” he
answered after searching the leaden sky for
some signs of a break in the low hanging
storm clouds.</p>

<p>Jack and Toad were too dejected in spirit for
conversation and since Bunny Baily was deeply
engrossed in a book of fiction and Dick Cory<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_3" id="Page_3">[3]</a></span>
and Harvey Maston were working out an absorbing
game of checkers silence reigned in the
room for some time. In fact a stranger passing
the door would never have suspected that
five perfectly normal, healthy boys were within.
But then the “D” club was composed of the
honor boys of Drueryville Academy and for
that reason if no other, they were bound to be
more dignified at times. You see the “D” club
was made up of the students who had won the
privilege of wearing a white and blue initial,
the insignia of the school, on their caps or
jersey; and in order to earn that distinction a
boy must needs work hard both in the class
room and on the athletic field. When a youth
successfully attained such laurels the crown
<em>was</em> apt to weigh heavily.</p>

<p>How long the clicking of checkers would
have remained the only sound is hard to tell
had not Tommy Todd happened to see Jack
Straw curled up in the window seat. He
paused a moment before Phillip’s Hall and
waved his hand in friendly greeting. Then he
splashed across the muddy road and came up
the stairs three steps at a time. Like a small<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_4" id="Page_4">[4]</a></span>
portion of the storm itself (for Tommy was by
no means a big boy) he burst into the room,
his yellow raincoat and rubber hat dripping
wet.</p>

<p>“Say, don’t flood the place!” shouted Jack
as he noted two growing pools of water on the
rug.</p>

<p>But Tommy only grinned as he removed his
wet garments and draped them over the back
of a chair so that they would drip on the
hearthstone.</p>

<p>“Sort of hard luck to have a day like this
happen along just when it isn’t wanted,” he
suggested to no one in particular. Then without
waiting for a response he looked at Jack
and spoke.</p>

<p>“Say old man, I can’t think what on earth
you’ve been up to recently, but there’s something
in the wind. Dr. Moorland wants to see
you as soon as possible. I just came from his
house and he asked me to look you up. I was
going on downtown first because the last place
on earth I ever expected to find you was in
your own room. What’s the trouble anyway?
You haven’t done something that will keep<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_5" id="Page_5">[5]</a></span>
you from getting through next week, have
you? It’s mighty close to the end of the term
and I hope you’ve been careful.”</p>

<p>At this Cory and Maston suspended their
game for a moment and Bunny Baily put down
his book. All eyes were turned on Jack Straw.
And as for Jack, it must be confessed he looked
startled and somewhat worried. Hastily he
ran through his mental diary, but so far as he
could see no one entry stood out above the rest
as warranting reprimand from the principal.</p>

<p>“I haven’t the slightest idea what he can
want of me,” he assured his guests as he
hastened into his bedroom and donned raincoat
and rubbers. A few moments later he
hurried out into the hall and down the broad
stairs toward the main entrance. As he
passed the mail rack in the hall he noticed a
letter waiting for him. Hastily he seized it
and crammed it into his pocket, noting as he
did so that the address was written in his
father’s hand.</p>

<p>Dr. Theodore Moorland, the principal, lived
in a modest little cottage on the north side of
the campus. It was almost hidden in a grove<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_6" id="Page_6">[6]</a></span>
of tall maples and, as if to make itself more
inconspicuous, it had permitted woodbine and
ivy to clothe its gray stone walls in a cloak
of soft green. A graveled road that wound
between fat old maples showed the way to the
front door, and it was up this much used path
that Jack Strawbridge hastened, his mind still
puzzled over the reason for such an unusual
command. The heavy old-fashioned door to
the cottage was equipped with a ponderous
brass knocker of quaint design which thumped
with such resonance as to spread consternation
in the soul of youngsters summoned
thither. Thus they were thoroughly disturbed
before they even faced the austere old master.</p>

<p>Such was not the attitude of Jack Straw,
however. He had not been able to remember
a single reason why he should expect to face a
scolding from Dr. Moorland. Every examination
paper had come back with excellent
markings and his conduct for some time past
had been beyond reproach. He thumped the
old door knocker twice in his eagerness to find
out just what the master wanted. Perhaps it
was news from home, he thought, and he comforted<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_7" id="Page_7">[7]</a></span>
himself by the fact that nothing serious
had happened to his father, for the letter in his
coat pocket attested to the fact that he was
still well enough to write. But while he was
speculating thus the door was opened by Dr.
Moorland himself.</p>

<p>The dignified pedagogue greeted the boy
with a broad smile and a hearty hand
shake.</p>

<p>“I didn’t know but what you and some of the
rest of the boys had about grieved yourselves
to death over your ill luck at having the championship
game broken up by the weather,” he
said as he ushered Jack into his study in a
secluded wing of the house.</p>

<p>“It is rather hard on us,” said Jack with a
smile. “Here we’ve been working since February
to get our team in shape for the trophy
contest and then a little thing like the weather
spoils it. Next year I think we will have to
arrange to have the championship game a little
earlier so there will be enough time to play it
in case of an emergency like this one.”</p>

<p>“Never mind, Jack, my boy,” said the principal,
“I have a mission for you that is calculated<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_8" id="Page_8">[8]</a></span>
to take your mind off baseball and
similar troubles for some time to come.”</p>

<p>The boy was plainly puzzled at this remark.
He looked curiously at the principal who was
striding the room nervously. Dr. Moorland
was a tall, broad shouldered man of sixty.
His hair was snow white and so long in back
that it curled down over his coat collar. A
pair of horn rimmed spectacles that were constantly
sliding forward on his nose made him
appear to be a testy individual, but in reality
he was a genial old gentleman who loved his
boys as much as if he was the father of every
one of them. The State of Vermont counted
him among the best of its educators and he was
famed throughout the country, indeed throughout
the world as a chemist.</p>

<p>“Jack,” he said after a long silence, “how
would you like to go to Mexico?”</p>

<p>“To Mexico!” gasped Jack.</p>

<p>“Yes, to Mexico. It will be an opportunity
for you to see a wonderful country and also
to make enough money to pay your tuition at
Drueryville next year. Do you care to go?”</p>

<p>“Why—why—Oh, I’d be delighted—but—well<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_9" id="Page_9">[9]</a></span>
I’d have to get father’s consent first, you
know.”</p>

<p>“Ah, Jack, you don’t suppose I would have
suggested the subject before consulting your
father about it, do you? I wrote him several
days ago and asked his permission to let you
go. I received word this morning that he was
perfectly willing to have you avail yourself of
the chance to see a little of the world providing
you cared to go. I wonder that he hasn’t
written to you about it.”</p>

<p>“Why, perhaps the letter I have in my pocket
now is about that very thing,” said Jack,
searching in his pocket for the envelope.</p>

<p>“Very likely,” said the principal, “but you
can read it after. Let me explain exactly what
I want you to do. When you have heard the
details you can decide better whether you want
to go.”</p>

<p>Dr. Moorland had ceased pacing the room
and settled deep in his comfortable study chair.
With what seemed exasperating deliberateness
to Jack, he removed his huge glasses and polished
them thoroughly on his handkerchief before
he was ready to talk. Then just as he<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_10" id="Page_10">[10]</a></span>
was about to begin he seemed to remember
something else of importance, for he began to
search drawer after drawer of his desk until
he finally brought to light a large yellow envelope
bulging with what appeared to be blueprints.
He tossed the package on the desk
before him and once again resumed his comfortable
attitude.</p>

<p>“Perhaps you never heard of my nephew,
Harry Ryder. In fact, I am quite certain you
haven’t, for he has never visited Drueryville
since you’ve been at school. Harry Ryder is
the chief engineer of the enormous hydro-electric
power plant at Necaxa where light and
power is supplied for Mexico City, the capital,
one hundred and twenty-five miles away. He
was appointed to that important position by
President Madero a year ago, and he has done
his best to keep Mexico City lighted in spite of
all the trouble in that turbulent republic, and
the recent change to the Huerta régime.</p>

<p>“Time and again rebels have tried to break
down the four transmission lines that carry
the current to the city but they have never yet
been successful and I judge from Harry’s letters<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_11" id="Page_11">[11]</a></span>
that he never intends they shall. But besides
rebels, Harry has other important things
to contend with. Up there in the mountains
where the plant is located, thunderstorms are
quite frequent and lightning is the troublesome
element. Lightning is electricity in its
most dangerous form, because of its very high
voltage. Voltage, you know, is the pressure
which causes it to travel. One of our scientists
once tried to measure lightning and
found that its voltage mounted well into the
millions. This is tremendous force when you
consider that the current used in lighting
houses and stores is supplied at one hundred
and ten volts.</p>

<p>“During thunderstorms the lightning plays
about the transmission lines, often causing a
great deal of trouble. If it should by any
chance get into the station it would raise havoc
with the generators and other machinery. To
prevent this, lightning arresters have been
constructed that will waylay the lightning, as
it were, and send it into the ground before it
reaches the vital machinery.”</p>

<p>Here Dr. Moorland paused and began to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_12" id="Page_12">[12]</a></span>
sketch rapidly on a piece of paper while Jack
looked on, still very much mystified.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 500px;">
<img src="images/sketch.jpg" width="500" height="420" alt="" />
<p class="caption">Dr. Moorland’s Sketch</p>
</div>

<p>“The usual transformer is arranged something
like this. First a choke coil is put in the
transmission line near the end. When the
lightning strikes this coil it piles up and is
forced back exactly like a flying wedge of
football players that suddenly tries to break
through an impregnable defense. The lightning<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_13" id="Page_13">[13]</a></span>
that is thus forced back rushes into line
‘A,’ which is the point of least resistance,
jumps the horn gap and plunges through the
arrester tank and into the ground. When the
excessive electricity has left the line and the
flow is normal, the current is checked at the
horn gap and arrested. This combination of
gap and arrester does not permit current to
flow into the ground during normal operation
and does not actually become active until lightning
gets into the line and there is danger of
the plant being wrecked by an overload of electricity.”</p>

<p>“My, but that is interesting,” said Jack
Straw as he fingered the master’s sketch. Indeed,
he had been so carried away with the
description of that interesting piece of engineering
work that for the moment he had completely
forgotten about Mexico. But Dr.
Moorland revived his interest with his next
sentence.</p>

<p>“And now for my reason for wanting you
to go to Mexico. The lightning arresters now
in use are not entirely satisfactory, and Harry
Ryder has been trying to build one on completely<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_14" id="Page_14">[14]</a></span>
new lines. Indeed, he has perfected
the contrivance, except for a neutral chemical
solution of a new nature for which he asked
me to construct a formula. He forwarded
his drawings for me to look over and now I
am ready to send them back. But a few
weeks ago, Harry communicated with me and
asked me to take particular care that the drawings
reach him safely. In fact, he suggested
that they be sent to him by messenger instead
of by the mails. You see, Mexico is in a state
of extended turmoil now with Villa, Carranza
and Zapata all carrying on campaigns against
Huerta, and under such conditions the mails
are not trustworthy. In fact, I understand
from Harry that three-quarters of the mail is
destroyed by revolutionary forces and that the
rest of it is left lying in almost any corner of
the republic until it can be distributed.</p>

<p>“These drawings,”—Dr. Moorland fingered
the bulky yellow envelope as he spoke,—“are
far too valuable to trust to such mail service
and since Harry is willing to meet the expenses
of a messenger and at the same time pay
him for his services, I can see no reason why<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_15" id="Page_15">[15]</a></span>
you should not be the one to take them safely
to Necaxa.”</p>

<p>“Why, I’d be delighted with the undertaking,
if you think I can do it satisfactorily,”
said Jack.</p>

<p>“And why can’t you do it satisfactorily?”
demanded the principal rather bruskly. “Any
boy whom the students of Drueryville honor
by electing captain of the football team for
two successive seasons certainly must have
some good qualities. You are strong and
healthy. You are not a coward and above all
you are reliable. These are qualifications that
I could not find in every man. Will you go,
Jack?”</p>

<p>“Yes, I will. When do I start?” asked the
boy enthusiastically, and from the expression
on his face it was evident that he was pleased
with the confidence the old master had in his
ability to carry out the mission.</p>

<p>“A steamer sails from New York on Saturday
next. I would like to have you be on
board when it leaves the dock for I am more
than eager to have the drawings back to their
owner and the responsibility off my mind.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_16" id="Page_16">[16]</a></span>
Then, too, I am afraid the hostilities in Mexico
might become more serious. You will have a
week to prepare for the journey, and since I
have looked up all your examination papers
and found them above the proper rating I will
excuse you from school for the last week of
the term and you can spend that time with
your father, for I know he has many things to
say to you. You can leave Drueryville on the
ten o’clock train to-morrow morning after you
have called here to receive final instructions
and the precious drawings. And now you
must hurry back to your room and pack.
Good afternoon and good luck to you.”</p>

<p>It was a rather serious moment for Jack
when he shook hands with Dr. Moorland. He
realized that the old schoolmaster was putting
great trust in him. It was in truth a struggle
for him to hide his emotions as he bade the old
man good afternoon.</p>

<h2 id="CHAPTER_II">CHAPTER II<br />
<span class="smaller">“IN SELF-DEFENSE OR A CAUSE THAT IS
HONORABLE”</span></h2>

<p>Townsend Strawbridge, Jack’s
father, lived alone in what was left of
a once very large estate in the upper end of
the pleasant Champlain Valley. The old
dwelling was located on the outskirts of the
village of Middlebury less than fifty miles
from Drueryville, and it was toward this point
that Jack hurried as soon as he received the
precious yellow envelope and final instructions
from Dr. Moorland.</p>

<p>Mr. Strawbridge had in his day suffered a
double misfortune through losing his wife and
his money almost at the same time. His story
was the same as that of many others in that
region of the country. He had discovered outcroppings
of another section of the rich marble
vein that runs from one end of the Champlain<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_18" id="Page_18">[18]</a></span>
Valley to the other and almost bisects
the State of Vermont. Lured on by the vast
fortune that certain other men were making
in marble quarrying, Mr. Strawbridge sought
to develop his own property. All the money
he had saved, as well as all that he could borrow
on mortgages, was invested in quarrying
machines, derricks and the like. With these
and a force of burly Canadian quarrymen he
went to work, opening quarry holes in what
had once been the farm’s pasture lot.</p>

<p>But unfortunately he had not been able to
gather together money enough to more than to
tide him over the early part of the operation.
This consisted in removing the top soil and
breaking away the upper layers of worthless
stone, a condition he had not reckoned with.
The result was that when the channeling machines
were finally put to work to get out the
first blocks Mr. Strawbridge found himself unable
to finance the undertaking much longer.
He tried to borrow more money, but before
he could successfully negotiate a loan the
quarrymen called a general strike throughout
the State and the men at the Strawbridge<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_19" id="Page_19">[19]</a></span>
quarries went out with the rest. The strike
affected the entire valley and every one was
pressed for money. Instead of making new
loans old accounts were called in, and since Mr.
Strawbridge had no way of meeting his debts,
the mortgages on his property were foreclosed.
However, he had steadfastly refused
to mortgage his house and the property on
which it stood. Nor would he jeopardize his
interest in the old pasture lot where the quarries
were located; consequently these sections
alone were saved to him.</p>

<p>On top of all this trouble Jack’s mother died.
This was almost more than Mr. Strawbridge
could stand and for several years he was very
much depressed. But gradually he was mastering
his unhappiness. He was, in fact,
working on a plan to organize a company and
develop his marble quarries and this served
to keep his mind occupied enough to prevent
unpleasant memories from creeping in.</p>

<p>Naturally his son was very dear to him. In
fact, he and Jack were more like chums than
father and son. In summer, during Jack’s
long vacation, they would go hunting and fishing<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_20" id="Page_20">[20]</a></span>
together and have a thoroughly good time
in general. In the fall and winter, when Jack
was at Drueryville, Mr. Strawbridge made
weekly visits to the old academy, just for the
pleasure of being able to chat with Jack and
his schoolboy companions.</p>

<p>Considering this mutual affection it may
seem strange that his father was willing to
let Jack spend his vacation in Mexico, but
then, as Mr. Strawbridge said in his letter to
Jack sanctioning the trip, “It is an opportunity
that you cannot well miss, as it will give
you a chance to see a very wonderful country.
If you do not avail yourself of this chance
you may have to wait a long time before I can
afford to pay the expenses of such a journey.
Besides, you will be able to earn enough money
to pay your tuition next year which also counts
for a great deal because I am now using every
penny I have at my command to re-establish
my fortune.”</p>

<p>When Jack reached home that Sunday afternoon
after leaving the academy, Mr. Strawbridge
was for putting by his plans for organizing
a quarry operating company and devoting<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_21" id="Page_21">[21]</a></span>
the entire week to his son. But Jack
would not hear to this, for he was thoroughly
interested in the work of reopening the
quarries. Mr. Strawbridge was well pleased
at this and explained all the intricacies of issuing
stock and organizing a company until the
boy had secured an excellent insight into business
of this nature. Many hours were spent
in wandering over the old pasture lot and
climbing in and out of the quarry holes. They
even visited other quarries that were being
successfully operated in the vicinity of Middlebury.</p>

<p>But though they were employed in working
out the more serious problems of life they
did find time to go a-wandering beside babbling
trout brooks with their fly rods. Altogether
they crowded more enjoyment into that
one week than they really expected and Friday
morning came all too soon for both of
them. This, in spite of the fact that Jack was
looking forward to his voyage to Mexico with
as much enthusiasm as ever.</p>

<p>After breakfast the last morning before his
departure Jack went over the contents of his<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_22" id="Page_22">[22]</a></span>
valise to see that nothing important had been
overlooked. While he was thus engaged his
father asked him to step into the library for a
moment. When Jack entered the room Mr.
Strawbridge was seated at his desk and before
him lay a huge blue steel Colt revolver, a well-worn
leather holster and a cartridge belt
studded with brass ends of many cartridges.
Jack had often viewed this weapon in his
father’s room and occasionally he had been
allowed to fire it at a target when his father
was at hand.</p>

<p>“My son,” said Mr. Strawbridge kindly as
he patted the heavy six-shooter, “you have
been greatly honored by your principal, Dr.
Moorland. He has asked you to undertake
a mission of importance. He has entrusted
you with valuable drawings, the loss of which
would mean the ruination perhaps of a man’s
most important contribution to the scientific
world. All this has pleased me a great deal
for I find satisfaction in knowing others besides
myself have faith in your ability to carry
out an undertaking. Do everything you can,
my boy, to have them retain this faith. I<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_23" id="Page_23">[23]</a></span>
realized when I gave you permission to go to
Mexico that I was letting you take your life
in your own hands. This worried me a great
deal at first, but I would not for anything in
the world cheat you of the honor of making
that journey successfully. You will be traveling
most of the time among people to whom human
life is of little value. These people are
violent and warlike. They are uneducated
and untrained, and all the time that you are
in their country your life will be in danger.
For that reason I am going to give you this
revolver. Take it and use it only in self-defense
or in a cause that is honorable. If
others believe that you are to carry out an important
task I am ready to believe that you are
careful enough to know how to use a weapon
of this kind and not misuse it.”</p>

<p>Jack’s heart beat fast as he took the heavy
holster and cartridge belt from the desk. He
always liked to feel it in his hands, and to examine
it closely. He had been accustomed to
firearms of all kinds, but this huge army revolver
fascinated him because of its massiveness.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_24" id="Page_24">[24]</a></span></p>

<p>“Father,” he said finally, “I shall be as careful
with this as you have been, and you can
be certain that whatever use it is put to will
be honorable.”</p>

<p>“Jack, I believe you,” said Mr. Strawbridge
heartily, as he grasped his son’s hand.</p>

<p>The rest of the day Jack and his father devoted
to planning the details of his trip and at
four o’clock Mr. Strawbridge opened the
heavy door of his private safe and took the
yellow envelope from the compartment in
which it had been reposing since Jack’s arrival
from Drueryville. He also took a heavy
waterproof wallet from the safe and emptying
the papers contained therein gave it to
Jack with instructions always to keep the precious
drawings in it. The wallet, with drawings
inside, Jack placed in an inner pocket of
his coat, taking good care first to see that there
were no small holes that might become enlarged
by the weight of the package, thereby
providing a way for it to slip through.
Shortly after that the village bus drove to the
door and Jack and his father bundled inside.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_25" id="Page_25">[25]</a></span>
Thus did our hero depart on the first stage of
what was to prove an unusual adventure.</p>

<p>The express from Montreal that was to take
him to New York was in the station when he
arrived and Jack had but a very few minutes
to say a last good-by to his parent. In fact,
the train started as they were shaking hands
and Jack just had time to toss his bag to a
dusky Pullman porter and swing aboard.</p>

<hr />

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_26" id="Page_26">[26]</a></span></p>

<h2 id="CHAPTER_III">CHAPTER III<br />
<span class="smaller">SEASICK</span></h2>

<p>Fortunately Dr. Moorland had arranged
all the details concerning Jack’s
sailing and had forwarded his steamship ticket
and stateroom reservation to him while he was
still in Middlebury, otherwise he never would
have made the Pringle Line pier before the
sailing hour. Somewhere south of Albany a
freight train had been wrecked during the
night and in consequence the entire line had
been tied up for three hours. The Montreal
express had merely crawled along for the
greater part of its journey and when Jack
awoke the next morning he found to his dismay
that it had many miles to go before it
reached the Grand Central depot. In fact,
when it finally pulled into the train shed the
young traveler had a little more than half an
hour in which to reach the Brooklyn dock.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_27" id="Page_27">[27]</a></span></p>

<p>Valise in hand he stood on the platform of
the first car when the long train rolled in.
And while the brakes were yet crunching
against the wheels he leapt down, to the imminent
peril of a colored porter whom he
nearly bowled over in his mad haste to reach
Forty-second Street. Down the long concourse
and through the waiting-room he hurried
until he finally gained the sidewalk.
There he hailed the first taxicab in sight.
Pausing only a moment to give the driver hasty
instructions, Jack plunged inside and immediately
was being whisked through New York
at top speed.</p>

<p>But with all this hustle and bustle he came
very near to missing the boat. Indeed he was
among the last aboard. All but one gang-plank
had been hauled in and the few remaining
visitors were being hastened ashore by the
stewards when he finally gained the deck and
paused to catch his breath. She was a long
low white-hulled steamer that sailed under
the name of the <i>Yucatan</i> and her seaworthiness
was apparent even to Jack, who had never
before set foot on a ship’s deck.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_28" id="Page_28">[28]</a></span></p>

<p>The first thing that the boy from Drueryville
Academy did after locating his stateroom
was to see that the wallet with its precious
contents was secure in its proper place.
His mind at ease on this point, he immediately
returned to the deck, for he was eager to see
the sights of New York harbor. The <i>Yucatan</i>
was slipping past the lower end of Governor’s
Island and the entire skyline of Manhattan
was spread out before his admiring
gaze. But presently, as the ship passed
Tompkinsville, his attention was diverted to
three huge gray vessels with queer basket-like
masts that were anchored just off the Staten
Island shore. He recalled that a United
States Navy coaling station was located in
that vicinity and concluded that this was the
reason for the presence there of three of the
largest of Uncle Sam’s battleships.</p>

<p>And as these vessels faded in the distance a
new delight was revealed to him. The <i>Yucatan</i>
was steaming down the Narrows toward
the lower bay and on either bank Jack beheld
the many innocent looking grass-grown terraces
of Fort Wadsworth and Fort Hamilton<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_29" id="Page_29">[29]</a></span>
behind which the deadly disappearing guns of
the harbor defense are concealed. The mere
sight of these embankments with the Stars
and Stripes whipping in the breeze above them
made the young Vermonter thrill with patriotism,
and for the first time in his life he realized
fully how glad he was that Yankee blood
coursed through his veins. And as he stood
there almost spell-bound by this picture of silent
power, some one at his elbow spoke to
him.</p>

<p>“They look almost impregnable,” said the
stranger, whereat Jack turned to find himself
addressed by a tall, good looking man whose
face was tanned to a ruddy brown, and whose
eyes sparkled with as much enthusiasm as his
own.</p>

<p>“Indeed they do, and I am proud of them,”
our young friend replied with feeling.</p>

<p>“So am I, son; so am I,” said the other with
equal fervor. “And every day I feel more
grateful to Providence for making an American
of me. You’ll appreciate it too after you
have traveled in foreign lands a little while.”</p>

<p>Jack instinctively liked this man. He was<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_30" id="Page_30">[30]</a></span>
so heartily enthusiastic about America and
everything American that the boy could not
help but admire him. Indeed he found him
decidedly interesting as a companion and they
chatted away about everything in general until
the <i>Yucatan</i> reached Sandy Hook. Here
the stranger brought forth a pair of binoculars
and scrutinized the beach and the Atlantic
Highlands beyond until he located the object
of his search. Then he passed the glasses
to Jack, saying as he did so:</p>

<p>“Here, look at the greatest lighthouses in
the world. See those two towers standing out
of the foliage over there on the hill. The reflection
of their lights can be seen seventy
miles out at sea.”</p>

<p>After a search Jack found them. They appeared
like the towers of some medieval castle
connected by a long low brick structure.</p>

<p>“Are those the Sandy Hook Lights?” he
queried.</p>

<p>“No,” said his companion, “they are officially
known as the Navesink Lights. The
Sandy Hook Light is that old octagonal white
tower over yonder. That is one of the oldest,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_31" id="Page_31">[31]</a></span>
if not the oldest, lighthouse in America. It
was built by the British Government in 1764
and during the Revolutionary War the King’s
soldiers used it as a military prison. Not long
ago when they were making some improvements
in the foundation a dungeon was unearthed
in which were found several human
skeletons, evidently Colonial soldiers imprisoned
there and not liberated when the lighthouse
was abandoned. Now if you will turn
your glasses off to the right you will be able to
see the Sandy Hook Lightship. That little
cockleshell of a craft is there winter and summer
fighting every storm and fog that comes
up. She’s in competent hands, however, for
the captain is a master mariner.”</p>

<p>Jack was exceedingly interested. He wondered
how his companion came to know so
much about lighthouses and lightships and several
times he was on the point of asking him.
This, however, was not necessary, for a few
moments later the information was furnished
quite voluntarily.</p>

<p>“By the way,” said the stranger, after Jack
had finished scrutinizing the tossing lightship,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_32" id="Page_32">[32]</a></span>
“I’ve neglected to introduce myself. My
name is Warner, James Warner, I am supposed
to be a marine engineer. You understand;
a builder of lighthouses, concrete dykes
and all that.”</p>

<p>“And I am John Strawbridge of Drueryville
Academy, but since Strawbridge is a rather
large mouthful I suggest you call me Jack
Straw. It’s handier, you know.”</p>

<p>“Jack Straw, eh? Well, that’s corking,”
said Mr. Warner heartily, clapping the boy on
the back. “Where are you bound for, Jack?
I’m on my way to Tampico. President
Huerta, of Mexico, has just given me a contract
to rebuild the foundation of the Lobo’s
Island Light. That is one of the most important
coast markings in Mexico.”</p>

<p>“I’m bound for Necaxa, by way of Vera
Cruz and Mexico City,” said Jack, who had
already begun to feel like a seasoned traveler.</p>

<p>“Necaxa,” exclaimed his companion; “why
that’s where the big hydro-electric power plant
is located. That’s where Mexico City gets its
light from. Harry Ryder, the engineer in
charge of the plant, is an old chum of mine.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_33" id="Page_33">[33]</a></span>
In fact, we were classmates at Sheffield Scientific
School.”</p>

<p>“Why, he’s the man I am expecting to visit
there,” said Jack, somewhat surprised at the
fact that Mr. Warner knew Dr. Moorland’s
nephew. He refrained, however, from telling
his companion the reason for his journey.</p>

<p>“Well, that’s mighty interesting,” replied
the marine engineer. “I haven’t seen Harry
Ryder in more than two years, though I’ve
kept in touch with him. He’s a very capable
fellow, and he deserves the honor of being in
charge of the largest electric station in Mexico.
He won the office, you know, about
a year or so ago. President Madero held
competitive examinations in Mexico City.
Harry carried off the highest honors. But
from what he told me he was rather hard
pressed by several other good electrical
engineers, both Americans and Mexicans. I
guess he expected to lose his position when
Huerta won the revolution and deposed
Madero. But the new president reappointed
him.”</p>

<p>Jack was greatly pleased to learn that Dr.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_34" id="Page_34">[34]</a></span>
Moorland’s relative was so well liked by his
former classmate. It served to increase his
interest in the man whose plans he was carrying
and he concluded that his visit to Mexico
was destined to be very pleasant with Mr.
Ryder as his host. He became silent after
that, for his thoughts were far away, anticipating
his sojourn in the land that Cortez conquered.
The voice of Mr. Warner interrupted
this pleasant mental occupation.</p>

<p>“Look over there on the horizon. That’s
a storm cloud. I rather think it’s fixing for a
blow. Do you ever get seasick?” he queried.</p>

<p>“Well, I’ve never had an opportunity to find
out,” said Jack, “for you see this is my first
experience on salt water.”</p>

<p>“Well, you’ll know within an hour. It’s
freshening up now and before long the boat
will be pitching around like a Mexican burro,
a beast you are destined to become acquainted
with before you have traveled in Mexico very
long.”</p>

<p>Jack smiled at Mr. Warner’s simile, but it
was not long before he noticed that the long<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_35" id="Page_35">[35]</a></span>
rolling swells had changed to white crested
waves that pounded against the steel sides of
the <i>Yucatan</i> with a hiss and a shower of salt
spray. The pitching of the ship had increased,
too, by the time he and Mr. Warner
went below for luncheon. Indeed, he found
it rather hard to follow his companion across
the dining saloon without seeming to stagger.
At the same time he began to feel very peculiarly.
It was as if he had been swinging
around and around so violently that he had
finally become very dizzy. He tried his best
to hide his feelings from Mr. Warner, hoping
that he would be a little better after he had
eaten. But his companion looked at him
sharply as he took his seat at the table and
Jack was certain that he saw the semblance of
a smile about the corners of his mouth. This
nettled the boy and he determined that he
would master the peculiar feeling immediately.
About that time, however, the waiter placed a
plate of hot soup before him. Jack looked
at it once and all his self-control vanished.
Somehow the sight of food made him extremely<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_36" id="Page_36">[36]</a></span>
ill and without even the formality of
excusing himself he pushed back his chair and
bolted for his stateroom.</p>

<p>Life hardly seemed worth living to Jack
Straw during the next three days for he was
so ill that he could not stir out of his stateroom.
The <i>Yucatan</i> pitched and rolled as if she was
being tossed about for a plaything by some
very inconsiderate giant, and it frequently
seemed to the boy that the steel hull was on
the point of foundering under the heavy seas
that broke against it. Nor did Jack care particularly
whether it did or not.</p>

<p>Several times he made an attempt to leave
his stateroom, believing that he would feel
very much better if he could only reach deck.
But each time he left his berth he became so
nauseated that he was glad to climb back
again. Mr. Warner made three efforts to
visit him but Jack had bolted the door against
all intruders, including a solicitous steward
who tried to persuade him to drink a cup of
tea and eat some hot toast.</p>

<p>On the morning of the fourth day out, however,
he awoke to find himself much relieved.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_37" id="Page_37">[37]</a></span>
To be sure he was very weak, but the sea had
gone down and walking was not the effort it
had been before. He found himself able to
eat a light breakfast and later he managed to
reach his steamer chair into which he sank
with a sigh of relief. He was not the only
passenger convalescing. Indeed all the occupants
of the steamer chairs were pale and weak
appearing and Jack found a great deal of satisfaction
in knowing that others had been affected
by the storm.</p>

<p>The <i>Yucatan</i> was plowing her way through
the dark blue water of the Gulf, riding the long
lazy swells with graceful ease, and to Jack,
who had never before been out of sight of
land, the vast stretch of water was awe-inspiring.
The vessel seemed small and insignificant
out there all alone and he wondered how Columbus
and other early adventurers had ever
found courage enough to sail for weeks over
untraveled seas knowing so little of their
destination. In fact, how mariners could
navigate a vessel even with present-day charts
and equipment seemed a mystery to the boy
from Vermont.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_38" id="Page_38">[38]</a></span></p>

<p>Late that afternoon while Jack was trying
to get interested in a book that he had brought
from his stateroom, Mr. Warner appeared on
deck. “By George,” he exclaimed as he
caught sight of Jack, “you’re not the boy with
whom I was talking a day or so ago! Why,
you look as pale as a ghost. You must have
had a rather disagreeable few days. Well, we
did run through something of a blow and I
guess you weren’t the only one who was seasick.
To tell the truth, I felt a little squeamish
myself for a time.”</p>

<p>“I think it was about the most unpleasant
sensation I ever had,” said Jack.</p>

<p>“You are right,” said Mr. Warner; “but
most of us have to experience it sometime.
Well, you are headed straight for your destination
now. I expect we will reach Tampico by
late to-morrow night or the following morning,
and after that it is only a day to Vera
Cruz. I am rather glad I came across you
here, for I’ve a lot of figuring to do on some
specifications I brought with me and I may
not have an opportunity to see you again before
I land. I’ll say good-by to you now and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_39" id="Page_39">[39]</a></span>
let me wish you the very best of luck in Mexico.
Be sure and remember me to Harry Ryder
when you see him and tell him also that I may
find an opportunity to visit him if I am in
Mexico long enough.”</p>

<p>Jack shook his hand warmly, for he had
come to like the marine engineer a great deal.</p>

<p>“I am sure we shall see each other again
some day,” he said as they parted company.</p>

<span class="smaller">AT ODDS WITH CUSTOMS INSPECTORS</span></h2>

<p>Though it was hardly daylight Jack
was up and dressed and on deck when
the Mexican pilot came aboard to take the
<i>Yucatan</i> into Vera Cruz. A filmy blue mist
was rising from the broad surface of the harbor,
making the white walled seaport seem
like a dream city. Dawn, like twilight, in the
Tropics is of brief duration, and the boy from
New England scarcely had time to mark the
fleeting changes of color along the eastern
horizon before the sun came up, dispelling at
once the lingering night mist. And with the
coming of day the city and the harbor became
alive. Tiny sail boats put out and from
wharves and jetties here and there puffing
tugs made their appearance.</p>

<p>Jack Straw watched the scene with eager<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_41" id="Page_41">[41]</a></span>
interest. It was all so new and so very unlike
what he had expected that he became
thoroughly fascinated. Off to the right he
beheld the frowning walls of the old fortress
and military prison of San Juan de Ulloa.
He recalled stories he had heard of its dungeons
where numberless horrible executions
had taken place, and he wondered how many
enemies of Huerta lingered there at the present
time. From this grim building he turned
his attention to the city. The spires of the
cathedral showed high above the housetops,
and as Jack caught sight of them there arose
the most confused jargon of metallic sound
that he had ever heard. It was as if a regiment
of blacksmiths were beating on cracked
anvils. He did not learn until he landed that
these sounds emanated from the belfry of the
cathedral and were caused by a group of bell
ringers bent on calling the population to early
mass.</p>

<p>In due time, after port inspectors, quarantine
officers, and a host of other uniformed individuals
had climbed aboard and inspected
every one and everything in sight, the <i>Yucatan</i><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_42" id="Page_42">[42]</a></span>
was permitted to make her way slowly to
the Pringle Line wharf.</p>

<p>Jack, valise in hand, was among the first
down the gang-plank, but he had hardly put
foot on the dock before he was accosted by another
uniformed attendant who spoke very
poor English. The boy managed after a great
deal of effort to understand that he was one of
the customs inspectors and that he was about
to make an examination of the contents of the
valise. Jack willingly unlocked the leather
bag and permitted the swarthy searcher to
tumble its contents about until he became convinced
that the youth had nothing on which
he could collect duty. But he did not seem
satisfied. He looked at Jack from head to
heels, noting particularly each one of his
pockets. Then suddenly he pointed to where
the leather wallet and drawing made the boy’s
coat bulge slightly.</p>

<p>“What—ah—have. Ah—you—ah—er—”
he puzzled his brain to know how to finish the
sentence in English. But finally becoming exasperated
he tapped Jack’s coat violently with
his fingers.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_43" id="Page_43">[43]</a></span></p>

<p>“<i lang="es">Aqui! Aqui! Aqui!</i>” (here! here! here!)
he demanded. Jack did not understand the
Spanish, but he knew that the leather wallet interested
the inspector. He hesitated to produce
it at first and tried to satisfy the dark-visaged
little man by telling him that it was
only a wallet. But the Mexican would not be
contented and in the end the boy had to reveal
to him the contents of the yellow leather case.
At the sight of the blue prints and sketches the
native became thoroughly aroused. He tried
to ask questions in English but became so
very confused that he resorted to his native
tongue and talked a perfect stream of Spanish.
And of course Jack was unable to understand
a word of it.</p>

<p>Then the Mexican beckoned the young
American to follow him, pointing at the same
time to a long low stone building near by which
Jack concluded was the custom house. Together
they hurried across the street, the inspector
chattering so hard that Jack’s protests
were lost completely.</p>

<p>The man led the way through several
rather poorly kept offices to the far end of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_44" id="Page_44">[44]</a></span>
building, where they entered what was evidently
the room of the Chief Inspector of the
port. An elderly and very dignified old gentleman
was the sole occupant. He was seated
at a desk in the far corner, but at their coming
he arose and advanced to meet them.
Immediately the little inspector became
thoroughly animated. He opened the wallet
(upon which he had kept a firm grip since
Jack gave it to him) and spread the drawings
on the table before his superior, talking very
fast all the while. Together the two Mexicans
examined each sketch, then finally the old
man turned and spoke to Jack.</p>

<p>“Do you converse Mexican?” he queried
and Jack shook his head.</p>

<p>The Chief Inspector clapped his hands
twice, whereat a servant appeared, to disappear
immediately upon receiving a few abrupt
instructions. Shortly after the servant entered
again followed by a light-haired youth of
about Jack’s own age, and undoubtedly an
American. The boy from Vermont was decidedly
pleased, but before he could speak the
Chief Inspector addressed the newcomer,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_45" id="Page_45">[45]</a></span>
pointing to the drawings and the wallet at the
conclusion of his remarks.</p>

<p>“He wants to know what these drawings
are,” said the interpreter; “he thinks that you
are a spy in the employ of the revolutionists
and that these papers are very important.”</p>

<p>“Please tell him,” said Jack with a smile,
“that the drawings are valuable only to one
person and he is the man who is making the
electricity which lights President Huerta’s
palace and the streets of Mexico City.”</p>

<p>There was a decided change in the attitude
of both officials when this was translated for
them. The Chief Inspector bowed and smiled
most apologetically.</p>

<p>“So, Señor Ryder. He is your friend?” he
said; “he is a—” but he could get no further
with his English, so he addressed the rest to
the interpreter who imparted it to Jack.</p>

<p>“He says that Mr. Ryder is a very wonderful
man and that if you are his friend he is
sorry that he detained you. You are free to
go now,” said the American, and Jack, after
thanking the dignified old Mexican, tucked the
wallet into his pocket and left the office. In<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_46" id="Page_46">[46]</a></span>
the corridor of the building he was overtaken
by the interpreter, who paused a moment to
speak.</p>

<p>“My name is Dave Anson,” he said, “and
if I can help you any, while you are in Vera
Cruz, just let me know. I always like to help
out a fellow countryman.”</p>

<p>“You have done a great deal for me already,”
said Jack, “for if it had not been for
you I am afraid I would have found myself in
a mighty unhappy position. I certainly am
obliged to you.”</p>

<p>“Oh, don’t mention it,” said Anson, then in
an undertone he added, “Don’t let the old chap
deceive you. I could see he was rather skeptical
about what you said, but he is afraid to detain
you any longer for fear you might have a
little more pull than he has, so he let you go.
Don’t worry; you’ll be shadowed every minute
that you are in Vera Cruz, so mind your actions.
Well, so long and good luck to you.”
The two boys shook hands warmly and parted.</p>

<p>Jack gave little thought to his recent experience
after he left the custom house, for he had<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_47" id="Page_47">[47]</a></span>
a great deal to attend to. First of all he must
find a banking house where he could get his
American money exchanged for Mexican currency.
Dr. Moorland had given him the address
of one of the few honest banking firms
in Vera Cruz, and after a long search he located
the place. He was very much surprised
to find that for every one of his American dollars
he received two Mexican dollars in exchange.
Indeed, his capital was doubled and
when he left the bank his trousers’ pockets and
wallet were weighted down with huge silver
coins. Jack’s next object was to find the railroad
terminal, and since an English speaking
clerk had given him explicit directions as to
its location he experienced little or no difficulty
in finding the long low building with its
dirty trainshed.</p>

<p>A great many of the railroad men in Mexico
above the grade of brakemen are Americans
and the young traveler had very little trouble
at the station. He learned, however, that he
had two hours to wait before the next train to
the capital would be made up, and after buying<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_48" id="Page_48">[48]</a></span>
his ticket and making Pullman reservations
he checked his valise and started on a trip
about the city.</p>

<p>Through hot unshaded streets he wandered,
peering into the curious little shops and watching
with interest the swarthy people. Finally
he reached the broad plaza with its imposing
cathedral, bandstand and line upon line of park
benches. Here he sat down to rest and watch
a score of dirty, half-clad children playing on
the sidewalk. They were apparently taking
part in a game and Jack tried very hard to understand
the details of it. Indeed he became
so interested that he did not realize some one
had taken the seat beside him until he felt a
hand upon his arm.</p>

<p>“<i lang="es">Un centavo, Señor, un centavo</i>,” pleaded a
whining voice, and Jack found himself accosted
by a very ugly and dirty-looking Mexican
with a monstrous hat. Though the lad
did not understand his language he had little
difficulty in guessing that the man was begging
for money. Eager to be quit of such an uncouth
companion he took several small coins
from his coat pocket and dropped them into<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_49" id="Page_49">[49]</a></span>
the beggar’s outstretched palm. But as he
did so he looked up to find a man on a bench
not far distant watching him closely.</p>

<p>He was rather well dressed when compared
to others Jack had noticed about the city, wearing
an unusually large sombrero of much better
texture than that of the beggar’s. The
brim and band about the crown was embellished
with Indian beadwork which made it
very picturesque. On being observed this man
lowered his eyes and began to roll a black paper
cigarette, nor did he look up again until Jack
left the bench and started across the plaza.
However, he watched the lad’s movements
from the corner of his eye until the Vermonter
turned toward the street that led to the railroad
terminal. Then he arose and followed at
a distance.</p>

<h2 id="CHAPTER_V">CHAPTER V<br />
<span class="smaller">IN THE HANDS OF THE SECRET SERVICE</span></h2>

<p>Although the train for Mexico City
was due to leave Vera Cruz promptly
on the hour, it was forty minutes late when
it started to get underway. This slight disregard
for schedule did not surprise Jack,
however, for already he had discovered this
natural failing of all Mexicans. The Pullman
coach in which he had secured accommodations
was fortunately one of a number of
American-built cars that had been taken over
the Rio Grande and into Mexico from time to
time during the extension of the national railroad
system, and in consequence the young
traveler did not suffer much from lack of comfort.
Before he had traveled very long Jack
realized that he had embarked upon the most
interesting portion of his journey to the power
plant. The train sped along through the most<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_51" id="Page_51">[51]</a></span>
wonderful country that he had ever seen.
Now he was racing through deep ravines with
perpendicular walls of rock rising so high that
daylight was almost shut out and perpetual
twilight reigned. From this he was whisked
into broad valleys with mountain ranges towering
on either side. And often the tracks led
high up on the sides of one of these mountains,
revealing a broad panorama of tropical country,
with Popocatepetl, the monstrous volcano,
in the distance.</p>

<p>Now and then Indian villages were passed
and Jack caught fleeting glimpses of a group
of thatched huts and adobes and crowds of
naked children and half-clad men and women
who stared stolidly at the train as it shot by.
Occasionally a stop was made at some large
town and picturesque groups of Mexicans
gathered at the station to stare in wonderment
at the passengers. Always these groups
were made up entirely of men, for the women
had far too much to do to waste time idly
watching trains. These men were a motley
throng, all wearing high-crowned, broad-brimmed
hats and gaily colored <i lang="es">serapes</i>, or<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_52" id="Page_52">[52]</a></span>
blankets, which they hugged close about them
in spite of the heat. The better dressed wore
trousers that were extremely tight fitting.
The others, however, wore frayed and tattered
garments made of everything from sail cloth
to sacking and ungainly sandals bound across
the arch and around the ankle with long buckskin
thongs. Not a shoe did Jack discover
among them.</p>

<p>What with the scenery and the picturesque
towns and villages, Jack’s interest was kept
out of doors for several hours. But eventually
even the novelty of traveling through a
foreign country grew wearisome and he
turned his attention to a book that he had
stowed away in his traveling bag. He had not
been reading long, however, before he began
to be troubled by a strange presentiment that
some one was watching him. Quite involuntarily
he glanced up from the page he was
perusing and looked into the bead-like eyes of
a native who was occupying a Pullman chair
at the other end of the car. Instantly the
Mexican’s eyes were turned away. The lad
became suspicious immediately, for he recognized<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_53" id="Page_53">[53]</a></span>
the man as the one who had watched
him in the plaza at Vera Cruz. There was
no mistaking him, for he wore the same big-brimmed
sombrero with its curious beadwork
binding.</p>

<p>Jack instinctively put his hand to the pocket
where he kept the wallet of drawings, for he
had a vague feeling that this man was interested
in them, though he really could not understand
why he should be since they had not
been exhibited at any place save in the custom
house. Then he suddenly recalled the
young American interpreter’s warning that he
would probably be closely watched at all
times! Was this man shadowing him? Had
he been trailed all through Vera Cruz? The
thought angered him and he glanced at the
Mexican again. That individual, however,
had removed his big hat and was gazing calmly
out of the window, as if he did not know that
Jack Straw ever existed, and his unconcerned
manner caused the young traveler to wonder
whether this second meeting was only a
strange coincidence after all.</p>

<p>Jack tried to resume his reading, but it was<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_54" id="Page_54">[54]</a></span>
not long before his mind was far from the
printed pages and busy evolving a plan
whereby he could become certain as to whether
the tall Mexican was watching him or not.
Soon the train began to slow down for another
stop and on the instant the American got an
idea. He waited until the train came to a
full stop; then as if he suddenly realized that
this was the station he wanted to get off at
he jumped up and seizing his traveling bag
bolted for the door.</p>

<p>It was all done so quickly that the Mexican
was taken completely off his guard. When he
saw the boy rush for the door he gave one
hurried glance up the car, then followed as
fast as he could. By the time he reached the
door, however, Jack had alighted and was racing
along the side of the car to the rear platform
where he swung aboard and returned to
the seat he had just vacated. He had successfully
lost the Mexican for five minutes at least,
for the man searched up and down the station
platform and in all directions trying to locate
the Vermonter. Then, purely by accident, he<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_55" id="Page_55">[55]</a></span>
looked toward the train again and saw Jack
smiling at him from one of the windows.</p>

<p>It was evident from his distorted features
that the native was thoroughly enraged. He
plunged for the train which was already underway
and swinging aboard hurried into the
Pullman car, brandishing a huge army revolver
as he advanced. Several women passengers
screamed and every man in the car
put his hands above his head when they saw
the angered native striding down the aisle.
They were certain that the train had been
boarded by highwaymen and that they were
about to be asked to turn over their valuables.
But the Mexican disregarded the disturbance
he had caused. He put the muzzle of the ugly
revolver against Jack’s breast and hissed:</p>

<p>“You, gringo, you are arrest for a spy of the
revolution. Not holler.”</p>

<p>But Jack did not intend to “holler.” With
the hard nose of the gun pressed against his
ribs he did not hesitate to put his hands above
his head as the other men in the train had
done.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_56" id="Page_56">[56]</a></span></p>

<p>“You are arrest by that great Secret Service
of Mexico,” said the native very impressively;
“give me up your guns.”</p>

<p>“I have no guns that are dangerous,” said
Jack Straw, and he spoke the truth, for the big
Colt that his father had given him reposed unloaded
and quite harmless in the bottom of
his valise. But the Mexican refused to believe
him.</p>

<p>“Give up or I make of you an examination,”
he said, trying hard to be courteous in spite
of his outraged temper.</p>

<p>“Search,” said Jack, “only let me put my
arms down.” And the detective forthwith began
to go through his pockets while the other
passengers, many of whom were Americans,
gathered around and looked on. One of the
first things that the detective did was to confiscate
the yellow wallet with the drawings.
His eyes sparkled with pleasure when he
opened it.</p>

<p>“Ah! Señor, it is for these you will be shot,
maybe. You are a bad gringo,” he said with
an evil chuckle.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_57" id="Page_57">[57]</a></span></p>

<p>“They are only working drawings of a machine,”
protested Jack.</p>

<p>“Yes, a war machine, I think,” said the
Mexican, continuing his search for firearms.
Finally, after finding nothing more formidable
than a jack-knife, the officer put his own revolver
away and informed Jack that he might
sit down and be at ease until they reached
Mexico City. He warned the boy, however,
that any attempt on his part to leave the car
would call forth the huge revolver again, and
since Jack had no desire to learn how good a
marksman the Mexican was he refrained from
rising from his Pullman chair for the rest of
the afternoon. The Secret Service man sat
directly opposite, his dark eyes never moving
from the lad from Drueryville.</p>

<hr />

<h2 id="CHAPTER_VI">CHAPTER VI<br />
<span class="smaller">ON TRIAL AS A SPY</span></h2>

<p>The lights of Mexico City were a welcome
sight to the young American.
Never had a train ride seemed so long. The
Secret Service guard refused to allow him conversation
with his fellow-passengers and as
the circumstances were too strained to permit
his reading with any degree of interest, Jack
had little to do but gaze out of the window
and think over his misfortune. The moment
the train rolled into the station, the detective
hustled Jack to the military barracks in the
heart of the city. It was almost midnight
when they were challenged by the white-clad
sentry before the heavy double gates of the
enclosure. Jack’s captor answered with a few
brief sentences in Spanish and the gates were
unbarred to let them pass. Inside another
sentry located the officer on duty and he and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_59" id="Page_59">[59]</a></span>
the Secret Service man held a short conference.
A few moments later two privates were
summoned. They took charge of the young
Vermonter, escorting him toward the far end
of the long barracks buildings, where he was
locked into a stuffy unlighted cell in the guardhouse.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 475px;" id="illus2">

<p class="caption">“To Jack it all seemed like a horrible nightmare”</p>
</div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_58" id="Page_58">[58]</a></span></p>

<p>To Jack it all seemed like a horrible nightmare.
Here he was a prisoner in the capital
of a strange country. He had no knowledge
of the language spoken by those with whom
he had to deal, nor did he have friends or relatives
within several thousand miles. His only
hope in being delivered from his rather serious
position lay in the possibility of calling
Harry Ryder to Mexico City so that he could
identify his drawings and explain how they
came to be in the possession of some other
person. But Jack was not altogether certain
that this could be done, or if it could be done,
whether his captors would be willing to take
that much trouble to prove him innocent. At
first he had taken the arrest more or less as a
joke, but as he reviewed the various stories
he had heard of the Mexican idea of justice,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_60" id="Page_60">[60]</a></span>
he became very much worried. He knew the
punishment meted out to a spy and he wondered
whether that would be his end. With
such thought parading through his brain, he
had little chance for sleep that night. Indeed
he heard a big clock beyond the barracks walls
toll every hour from midnight until dawn.</p>

<p>At seven o’clock breakfast was brought to
him by an uncouth looking private in a dirty
white uniform. The meal consisted of <i lang="es">tortillas</i>,
made of corn flour, and <i lang="es">frijoles</i>, which
are black Mexican beans. There was not
even a cup of water with which to wash it
down. Though Jack had had very little to
eat the day before, the sight of the mess
brought by the soldier sickened him, and he
put the tin plate aside untouched.</p>

<p>An hour later an officer with four privates
came into the guardhouse and unlocked the
door of Jack’s cell. The lad observed that
each of the soldiers carried a shining rifle at
port arms and the officer entered with sword
drawn. At this he became speechless with
horror. Was this a firing squad! Was he
going to be executed without the formality of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_61" id="Page_61">[61]</a></span>
trial? He was almost too weak to walk when
the officer spoke to him in Spanish and motioned
for him to come forth. Silently the
soldiers formed behind him and urged him
forward out of the guardhouse and on to the
parade grounds.</p>

<p>His heart-breaking suspense ended there,
however, when he noted the direction in which
the soldiers turned him. Instead of marching
out into the center of the enclosure they headed
directly for a building that looked very much
like a large dwelling. To the young American
it appeared as if it might be the home of
the commander of the barracks. He hoped it
was, for in that case he could be certain of
some form of trial at least, during which he
could doubtlessly explain about the drawings.</p>

<p>The boy was ushered before the austere old
General by the officer alone, the guard remaining
on duty before the door. The commander
was seated at a desk in the center of a well-lighted,
cheerful-looking room, a uniformed
orderly at his elbow. The other occupant of
the room was the Secret Service man who had
arrested him the day before. Both were poring<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_62" id="Page_62">[62]</a></span>
over the drawings of the lightning arrester
which the detective had confiscated, while on
the corner of the officer’s desk was Jack’s
traveling bag which had been forced open,
possibly for the purpose of finding other evidence
against him.</p>

<p>The detective and the officer looked up as the
youth entered. Jack’s officer escort saluted
and retired to the rear of the room, leaving the
lad standing in the middle of the floor alone.
The detective cleared his throat and spoke.</p>

<p>“I shall be what you call the interpreter. I
spik Mexican, I spik also Inglis. Shall you
be content?” he queried.</p>

<p>“I will be contented if you will believe what
I tell you,” said Jack rather curtly. “It is ridiculous
to arrest me as a spy. I am an American
citizen and those drawings are not war
plans or details of a ‘war machine,’ as you suggested
yesterday. They are plans for an electrical
appliance that is to be built by Mr.
Harry Ryder, in order to give better light to
Mexico City.”</p>

<p>The detective looked at him with doubt
plainly written on his countenance. Then he<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_63" id="Page_63">[63]</a></span>
turned and in rapid fire sentences imparted
Jack’s story to the general. The officer also
appeared to doubt the youth’s statement. He
was silent for a few moments, however, while
he pondered the situation; then through the
interpreter he asked:</p>

<p>“Why does Mr. Ryder trust his valuable papers
to you?”</p>

<p>“Because he didn’t care to trust your unreliable
mail service,” said Jack vindictively.</p>

<p>The wrath of the detective was stirred immediately.</p>

<p>“Mexico is a great country. She has a dependability
of mail service. You are a gringo
who spies for the revolution. Do not tell me
not. I saw you with my own eyes pass some
secret something to a sympathizer in the plaza
at Vera Cruz. Ah, but he are arrest already
and your secret is now known.”</p>

<p>Jack was startled at first. Then as he recalled
the whining beggar in the plaza he
laughed heartily.</p>

<p>“Why, he was only a beggar. I gave him a
few coins. You are making a mountain out
of a mole hill, Mr. Detective. Why not have<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_64" id="Page_64">[64]</a></span>
done with all the foolishness by summoning
Mr. Ryder from Necaxa? He will prove that
the drawings are his and that I am no spy.”</p>

<p>The General and the Secret Service man debated
this suggestion for some time. Evidently
they thought it a good idea, for the
officer presently began to use the telephone at
his elbow while the detective talked to Jack.</p>

<p>“We will call Señor Ryder. General
Rodriguez say the great electrical engineer is
in Mexico City now. He spoke with him in
the café last evening. He will come maybe,
and then if you can prove, you must prove.
If you don’t, you will be shot to-morrow.”</p>

<p>The commander ceased his telephoning
after a few moments and spoke to the interpreter,
who, turning to Jack, announced:</p>

<p>“Señor Ryder is at the office of the Compania
de Luz y Fuerza Montriz in Calle de
Tetuan. He will be here quite soon.”</p>

<p>The General and the Secret Service agent
spent the next fifteen minutes smoking numerous
black paper cigarettes and talking
quite excitedly to each other while Jack was
left standing in the center of the room. The<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_65" id="Page_65">[65]</a></span>
waiting was ages long for the American. But
finally there sounded the tooting of an automobile
horn and roar of a motor from the
parade ground outside and a moment later a
tall fine-looking American, clad in linen
trousers and soft shirt, entered the commander’s
office.</p>

<p>Jack stepped forward instantly and held
out his hand.</p>

<p>“Mr. Ryder,” he said, “I am John Strawbridge,
Dr. Moorland’s messenger. I have
been arrested and am being held as a spy because
I happened to have your drawings in my
wallet. You see it excited the curiosity of
the customs inspector yesterday and the result
is I am in the hands of the Mexican Secret
Service to-day. I sincerely hope that you can
get me out of this rather disagreeable position;
otherwise I’ll furnish the target for a firing
squad to-morrow morning.”</p>

<p>“Why, this is ridiculous,” said Mr. Ryder as
he saw his drawings spread out before General
Rodriguez. Then he began to talk in
Spanish to the natives. A few moments conversation
was all that was necessary to convince<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_66" id="Page_66">[66]</a></span>
the Secret Service agent and the officer
that a serious mistake had been made, and
each was profuse in his apologies to Jack
Straw.</p>

<p>“It is a great regret that I arrest so honorable
friend of Señor Ryder,” said the detective
with a sweeping bow. “I hope you will
pardon, Señor.”</p>

<p>And Jack showed the sort of stuff Americans
are made of by stepping forward and
warmly shaking hands with the Secret Service
agent and the commander.</p>

<h2 id="CHAPTER_VII">CHAPTER VII<br />
<span class="smaller">OFF FOR NECAXA</span></h2>

<p>Jack was not long in discovering that
Harry Ryder was a prince of companions.
After the little incident at the barracks they
were fast friends. Of course the engineer
was somewhat older than the boy from
Drueryville, having just turned twenty-nine,
but withal he was decidedly boyish in spirit.
The big gray motor car that stood in front of
the commander’s house was the engineer’s
latest toy and nothing would do but that Jack
should accompany him on a tour of the capital
of “this benighted country,” as he termed
Mexico. And he made an excellent guide.</p>

<p>Until long after midday they went flying up
one street and down another, while Mr. Ryder
pointed out all the places of interest. First
they visited the Plaza Mayor, or Zocalo, as it
is frequently called. And while Jack was<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_68" id="Page_68">[68]</a></span>
noting each interesting detail about the imposing
public buildings, the Cathedral and the
National Palace, the engineer explained the
history of that remarkable section of the City
of Mexico.</p>

<p>“This,” he said, “was the heart of the Aztec
capital four hundred or more years ago. Indeed,
that building over there, the National
Palace, was constructed on the very site of
the splendid palace of the old Indian ruler
Montezuma. And as for the Cathedral, that
is built on the very foundation stones that held
the wonderful Tecalli, the Aztec temple,
where from twenty to fifty thousand lives were
sacrificed annually to the powerful Indian
deity Huitzilopotchli. The present Cathedral
with its towering spires was erected in 1573
and is the most imposing edifice of its kind in
the whole of North and South America.”</p>

<p>From the Plaza Mayor they turned to other
interesting portions of the community. The
famous tree under which Cortez is said to have
wept was pointed out by Mr. Ryder; also the
various monuments and buildings associated
with the old Spanish adventurer. They traversed<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_69" id="Page_69">[69]</a></span>
the causeway over which Cortez retreated
and ultimately visited Chapultepec
where the Indian rulers once maintained magnificent
dwellings.</p>

<p>It was nearly one o’clock when the car rolled
into the heart of the city again and stopped before
the door of the American Hotel. There
Jack and the engineer climbed out, but before
Mr. Ryder entered the hotel he inspected his
new machine thoroughly.</p>

<p>“That’s a great plaything,” he said enthusiastically.
“I bought it a month ago, and I
usually arrange to get into the city every
Sunday to take a drive. You see I have to
leave it here because there is no roadway out
to Necaxa, only a pack train trail and our narrow-gage
railroad. I couldn’t very well use
it out at the power plant anyway for it’s a
trackless wilderness there.”</p>

<p>On entering the hostelry the two Americans
lost no time in finding the dining-room, for the
drive had given them both a ravenous appetite.
They ate in silence for a time, for the business
of satisfying their hunger was of great importance.
But when coffee was finally served<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_70" id="Page_70">[70]</a></span>
and each felt that they had done credit to the
ample portions afforded to them, Mr. Ryder
began to talk.</p>

<p>“You know, Jack, I think it was mighty
lucky for you that I happened to be in Mexico
City. Otherwise you would probably have
been compelled to spend several days in jail.
And it is even possible that they would not have
taken the trouble to send to Necaxa for me. A
Mexican’s idea of justice is rather crude.
Frequently they shoot a suspect and then debate
his guilt or innocence over his body. Old
Rodriguez and his Secret Service friend were
quite positive that you were a spy, and I am
afraid that the cartridges with which you were
to be executed had already been dealt out, figuratively
speaking.”</p>

<p>Jack shuddered as he thought of his narrow
escape.</p>

<p>“I guess that I <em>was</em> very fortunate having
you so near at hand,” he said.</p>

<p>“Well, I’ll be quite honest with you, Jack,
this visit to Mexico City was not a matter of
choice with me. I was requested to appear
before the officials of the company and old<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_71" id="Page_71">[71]</a></span>
Huerta himself. You see things have been in
a devil of a mess at the plant recently and we
have had some trouble in keeping the old city
supplied with enough light. I fancy it has
been getting on Huerta’s nerves and he has
been calling the company’s officials to account.
They in turn pass the calls along to me.</p>

<p>“You see some of the hundred or more
workmen at the plant have developed revolutionary
ideas. They seem to be Zapata sympathizers
and they are doing all they can to
make things unpleasant for Huerta. They
have been crippling machinery from time to
time, tampering with the searchlights, putting
dirt in the bearings of the generators and
raising the dickens in general. Of course this
reflects on my management and I feel rather
ugly about it all. But the men who do it keep
pretty well under cover. I wish that I could
find out just which of the greasers are the trouble
makers. I’d have them line up against the
station wall and drilled through with some of
their own soft-nosed bullets. That may sound
a little inhuman, but honestly one cannot afford
to treat them otherwise. As a matter of fact<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_72" id="Page_72">[72]</a></span>
their fate is not in my hands. The moment
we discover a sympathizer the rurales stationed
at the plant as special guards take the
matter in their own hands and all that we hear
of the case after that is the report of the carbines.
Oh, they make very little bones about
human life down here. And that reminds me,
have you provided yourself with a protector
in the form of a revolver? If you haven’t
we’ll see that you are supplied with one before
we start back for the plant this afternoon.”</p>

<p>“I have my father’s big blue steel Colt,”
said Jack with pride. “It’s right here in my
traveling bag. But I haven’t much ammunition,
only the cartridges in the belt.”</p>

<p>“Well, you’d better buckle it on your hip
when we start. You will probably find a great
deal of comfort in having it handy all the time
you remain in Mexico. Why, you should see
our plant. It’s a veritable fortress with its
rows of trenches, its barbed-wire barriers,
its squadron of rurales and detachment of infantry.
And our working force is drilled to
do some fine defense work too. We are all
equipped with Mauser rifles and we have a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_73" id="Page_73">[73]</a></span>
battery of new French rapid-fire guns and a
three-inch fieldpiece that can throw a shell
clean over the top of the nearest mountain.
We know it will do that for not long ago we
had occasion to bombard a handful of Zapatistas
from a position on the cliffs a mile away.
The rats had an old fieldpiece and they managed
to get a couple of solid shot down
through the roof of a storehouse near the
plant. Oh, we have had an interesting time
out there for the last eight or ten months.
The Zapatistas have been hovering around like
a swarm of bees. They haven’t managed to
do much damage, however, but we never know
when they will be joined by other mobs of guerrilla
soldiers who are operating in that section
of the mountains. When that happens then I
guess we can look for real trouble.</p>

<p>“I arranged with General Rodriguez last
night to have another detachment of infantry
accompany us to the plant this afternoon. I
think it would be wise to strengthen the guard
out there at any rate. We are going out on a
train of flat cars that will be ready to move
shortly so I guess we had better be getting<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_74" id="Page_74">[74]</a></span>
ready. I’ll drive you over to a gunsmith’s and
you can get all the ammunition you want, then
we’ll start for the railroad.”</p>

<p>At the gunshop Jack laid in five hundred
rounds of ammunition. This seemed a ridiculously
large amount but Mr. Ryder assured
him that it was wise to be on the safe side in
such matters. Several other stores were
visited where Jack purchased some clothing
suggested by Mr. Ryder for service at the
plant. The most important purchase was one
of the huge sombreros such as the natives
wear. This was secured at a little hat booth
on one of the side streets. Jack was amazed
at the size of some of these hats and while he
was looking over the assortment offered, Mr.
Ryder explained that the natives were very
vain about their hats. He said that in former
days the wealthy Mexicans vied with each
other to see who could wear the hat with the
largest brim and the most costly embellishments.
This competition reached the point
where it finally became a public nuisance, for
the big hat brims were decidedly objectionable
on crowded thoroughfares or street cars. The<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_75" id="Page_75">[75]</a></span>
federal government finally took the matter in
hand and imposed a tax of a certain amount
for every four inches of brim over a stipulated
size. This ordinance put the hat brims at a
universal width.</p>

<p>After the shopping they hurried back to the
hotel where Mr. Ryder always maintained a
room. Their clothes were changed and garments
of the rough-and-ready sort adopted.
Jack felt very self-conscious as he buckled on
the heavy revolver and donned the high-crowned
sombrero, but he did his best to hide
it from his companion. On his way out of the
hotel, however, he surreptitiously glanced at
his reflection in one of the large mirrors and
found to his great satisfaction that such toggery
was not at all unbecoming. He secretly
resolved to have some photographs made
which he intended to take back to Drueryville
when he returned.</p>

<p>The train that was to carry them out to
Necaxa was, as the engineer had said, nothing
more than a string of flat cars with a yellow
caboose at the end. It was a narrow gage
railroad that was built especially to carry supplies<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_76" id="Page_76">[76]</a></span>
to the power station, one hundred and
twenty-five miles back in the mountains.</p>

<p>Two of the flat cars were heaped high with
boxes of provisions and barrels of flour, all on
the way to the little community at the power
house. Three other cars were occupied by the
detachment of infantry from the barracks.
The soldiers were not a prepossessing lot, Jack
thought, as he viewed them. They were uniformed
alike, of course, and for the most the
uniforms were in rather good order though
somewhat dirty. Their hats were not unlike
the forage caps of the United States troops
during the Civil War, with the exception that
they were higher in the crown. The men were
all dark skinned and ugly looking, and the
young American was quite certain that as
enemies they would probably be decidedly
vicious customers.</p>

<p>Three officers accompanied the detachment
but they held themselves aloof from the rest of
the soldiers, sharing the caboose with Jack and
Mr. Ryder. They were tall, fine-looking specimens
of Mexican manhood, very jaunty in
their gold-braided uniforms, and Jack found<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_77" id="Page_77">[77]</a></span>
them very companionable after they became
acquainted, for they could speak English after
a fashion and some of the war stories they told
helped to make the slow journey into the mountains
less tedious.</p>

<p>On leaving Mexico City the train started to
climb immediately for the way was entirely up
grade, the plant being situated at a higher
altitude than the capital. As a result of this
and the unusually heavy load, the little engine
made slow progress. Indeed, at some points
in spite of its snorting and puffing it could not
go on and the men were forced to get down
from the flat cars and walk, thereby lessening
the load. Because of this slow progress it was
long after nightfall when Jack discovered a
long pencil of light reaching out across the sky.
It looked weird and uncanny off there in the
solitude of the mountains. But as he watched
it began to move along the ridges, searching
out each valley and depression. Then Jack
understood. It was the huge searchlight at
the plant, looking among the hills for lurking
bands of Zapatistas.</p>

<p>The lad watched the light travel from point<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_78" id="Page_78">[78]</a></span>
to point until finally it located the supply train,
which it escorted all the way to the station, illuminating
the tracks just ahead of the engine.</p>

<hr />

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_79" id="Page_79">[79]</a></span></p>

<h2 id="CHAPTER_VIII">CHAPTER VIII<br />
<span class="smaller">THE CRIPPLED GENERATORS</span></h2>

<p>It was a veritable fortress that Jack entered
when he left the caboose of the supply train.
Before him, on a slight eminence, was the massive
building of the power station with the
searchlight mounted on the roof. The grassy
slope below was marred by a double line of
trenches unoccupied, of course, save for one
or two white-clad sentinels who paced back and
forth restlessly. On the lawn between the
first trench and the station, the lad noted a
bulky object covered with canvas. This he
immediately decided was the three-inch fieldpiece
about which Mr. Ryder had spoken. To
the north of the station was the irregular outline
of many small cottages. As the searchlight
threw its rays in that direction, the boy
observed that nearly all of them were constructed
of wood and erected after the fashion<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_80" id="Page_80">[80]</a></span>
of the cottages furnished to the quarrymen
in Vermont. There were also several
long low shed-like structures which he learned
later housed the soldiers. The entire community
did not occupy more than five or six
acres and was entirely cut off from the surrounding
country by barbed wire barricades.
Indeed, the place looked well-nigh impregnable
to the American. To approach from the
north, south or west, invaders would have to
get through the mass of barbed wire first and
carry two lines of trenches before they reached
the station, and as far as the east side of the
plant was concerned, approach in that direction
was made impossible by the roaring mountain
stream that furnished water to the station’s
turbines.</p>

<p>The enclosure became a perfect bedlam a
few moments after the supply train rolled in.
To the roar of the river and the grumble of the
huge generators inside were added the shouts
of the soldiers detraining and unloading the
supplies. The entire barracks had turned out
to welcome the reinforcements, for it happened
that they composed two companies of the same<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_81" id="Page_81">[81]</a></span>
regiment. Altogether Jack estimated that
there were more than 200 men ready to defend
the place against the rebels, not including the
squad of twenty-five rurales who were stationed
there to patrol the surrounding country.
The rurales, the lad learned, were not soldiers
in the stricter sense of the word. They are
maintained by the Mexican Government to do
practically the same work as that required of
the famous Canadian mounted police; which
is to rid the country of bandits, smugglers and
bad men, and run down the outlaws that hide
in the mountains. They are far better drilled
than any of the Mexican troops and are well
equipped with clothing and firearms. Their
horses are the best that Mexican dollars can
buy. These men ride exceptionally well, shoot
almost as accurately as the Texas ranger and
are brave and fearless. A Mexican president
who believed in the old saying that “it takes a
thief to catch a thief,” organized the rurales
years ago when the country was infested with
bandits and bad men. Every time one of these
men was apprehended he was forced to join
the rurales and hunt down bandits. In this<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_82" id="Page_82">[82]</a></span>
way his vicious nature was well satisfied and
at the same time he was able to consider himself
a law-abiding citizen, which usually appeals
to all individuals who have been outlaws
for any length of time. To Jack these soldier-policemen
were very picturesque as they swaggered
about in their dark-green, tightly fitting
uniforms and broad-brimmed hats. He noticed,
however, that they did not associate with
the white-clad regulars, but stood apart in a
little group by themselves and watched the
other men unload the cars.</p>

<p>Mr. Ryder and Jack lingered long enough to
see that the unloading was well under way before
they turned toward the station.</p>

<p>“I’ve a strange premonition that the troublemakers
hereabout have taken advantage of my
absence,” said the engineer as they approached
the office. “I would not be surprised to find
the plant dynamited some day. These rebel
sympathizers will go the limit to make it disagreeable
for old Huerta.”</p>

<p>The office of Ben Nedham, first assistant engineer,
was vacant. When Mr. Ryder saw
this he looked worried. Immediately he<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_83" id="Page_83">[83]</a></span>
bounded up the spiral iron staircase to the balcony-like
control room where the switchboards
were located. Allen Lyman, a tall light-haired
American in charge of that section of the
plant, advanced to meet him, and his face also
bore a troubled look.</p>

<p>“They’ve been at it again, Mr. Ryder,” he
exclaimed. “We haven’t been able to carry
the load all evening. Machines five and six
are out of commission. Couldn’t even start
them. Nedham and a gang are down there on
the generator floor now trying to patch them
up.”</p>

<p>“What is the trouble?” demanded the engineer,
his brow wrinkled by a perplexed
frown.</p>

<p>“Well, some one got in after two o’clock this
morning, evidently, and threw a bucket full of
fire sand into the gears of both machines.
Nedham has had only one watchman here and
he must have gone to sleep.”</p>

<p>“Have you heard from Mexico City yet?”
demanded Mr. Ryder anxiously.</p>

<p>“No, not yet, but we can gamble that the
lights are mighty dim there. Shouldn’t wonder<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_84" id="Page_84">[84]</a></span>
but what we’ll get a call before the night
is over.”</p>

<p>He had hardly completed the sentence when
the telephone bell on the desk in the center of
the room jangled sharply.</p>

<p>“Dollars to doughnuts that’s Mexico City
now,” exclaimed Lyman as he removed the receiver.
A moment he talked with the man
on the other end of the line; then he beckoned
to Mr. Ryder.</p>

<p>“It’s President Huerta himself,” he said,
holding his hand over the transmitter. “He’s
as mad as a Mexican bull too. Wants to speak
with you.”</p>

<p>For fifteen minutes the chief engineer attempted
to explain the situation to the country’s
executive, and in the meantime Jack
busied himself trying to puzzle out the reason
for all the switches, knobs, handles and indicators
on the huge marble switchboard that
extended all the way around the circular room.
He knew that all the machinery in the station
was controlled from that board, but just how
it was done he had not the slightest idea. He
decided, however, to take advantage of the first<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_85" id="Page_85">[85]</a></span>
opportunity and learn the function of each of
the mysterious looking black rubber handles.</p>

<p>Mr. Ryder left the ’phone apparently thoroughly
angry. He paced the narrow room for
some time before he uttered a word. Finally,
pausing before the desk again, he brought his
fist down with a resounding blow.</p>

<p>“By Jupiter,” he thundered, “this <em>must</em> stop
or I’ll know the reason why. The old man is
as peeved as a wet hen and I don’t blame him.
He informed me that we had made a failure
out of the most important state function of the
year simply because the palace was so poorly
lighted. They had to resort to smoky oil lamps
to help out. He was furious. Told me the
city looked like an Indian village, it was so
dark. Oh, if I could only get my fingers on
the villains who did this work!”</p>

<p>Thus did he storm to Jack and the operator
until he became thoroughly out of breath and
was forced to pause. Then turning he called
Jack and started down the spiral stairs again.
Three flights they descended until they reached
the floor of the generating room. Six huge
generating units occupied the space. They<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_86" id="Page_86">[86]</a></span>
were great black monsters of steel that
looked like so many mastodons chained to the
floor. Water was roaring down from the
forebay through four of the massive penstocks
that supplied the turbines, but the other
two were silent. Around each of these silent
machines was gathered a group of workmen.
They had unbolted the steel protecting plates
and were assiduously wiping the sand from
the delicate armature bearings. Some of these
workmen were Americans but there were a
number of Mexicans among them, many of
whom were distinctly of the peon class, with
bared feet and shabby garments.</p>

<p>As Jack and the engineer hurried across the
floor a short, dark-haired American advanced
to meet them.</p>

<p>“We’ve trouble on our hands this time!” he
exclaimed. “The two machines are full of
sand and we won’t be able to get them cleaned
until long after midnight.”</p>

<p>“Well, how did it happen, Nedham?” demanded
Mr. Ryder. “You were in charge
while I was away and you are responsible.
Are you going to let this plant go to the devil?<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_87" id="Page_87">[87]</a></span>
I got a good blowing up yesterday from the
board of directors and here to-night President
Huerta himself had me on the long distance
telephone. Told me flatly that things
would have to go smoother; and I propose to
see that they do go smoother hereafter.”</p>

<p>“How do I know how it happened? Maybe
I was in charge, but they manage to work the
same tricks when you are here too, so you
can’t altogether blame me,” said Nedham indignantly.</p>

<p>“Well, I suppose not,” replied Mr. Ryder in
calmer tones. “I didn’t mean to accuse you of
neglect of duty. I know they work the same
tricks on me too. I hope you’ll pardon my
temper.”</p>

<p>The chief engineer extended his hand in cordial
apology and Nedham grasped it, his anger
disappearing immediately.</p>

<hr />

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_88" id="Page_88">[88]</a></span></p>

<h2 id="CHAPTER_IX">CHAPTER IX<br />
<span class="smaller">JACK PROPOSES A TRAP</span></h2>

<p>Nedham was right. It was some time
after midnight before the big generators
were in condition to operate again.
For hours the men toiled to get every vestige
of the gritty substance out of the machines.
Mr. Ryder went at the task with the rest, and
Jack, unwilling to remain idle, rolled up his
sleeves and seized a piece of cotton waste also.
With the steel jacket removed, an excellent opportunity
was afforded the lad for a better acquaintance
with the mechanism of a water turbine
generator, and as he worked beside Mr.
Ryder, the engineer briefly explained the details.</p>

<p>“This is not really a generator that we are
working on, Jack,” said Mr. Ryder, “because
a generator is supposed to create energy.
This does not do that. The real energy is in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_89" id="Page_89">[89]</a></span>
the water that turns the turbine, and this machine
merely converts that energy into electric
current, so you see the word ‘generator’ is a
misnomer in this case. It is the same in a
steam plant. Steam furnishes energy which
is converted into electricity by the so-called
generators. In fact, man-made electricity is
nothing more or less than some other kind of
energy in a new and more useful form. I
guess you follow me.”</p>

<p>“I understand all right,” said Jack, “for it
is very simple, though I must confess I had
never considered electricity in that way before.”</p>

<p>“The energy here comes from the water that
plunges over the dam we built across the river
about a mile back in the mountains. The dam
is sixty-odd feet high and the water that is
stored up behind it is carried down to the
plant here through a very large flume. The
flume is built at the same level as the dam and
brings the water around the mountain to the
north of the plant and into the big forebay or
reservoir just back of the station.</p>

<p>“The water in the forebay is kept at about<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_90" id="Page_90">[90]</a></span>
the same height as the dam also, so it can get
a sixty-foot direct drop to the turbines here
in the building. The stream rushes down
through the large penstocks, or feeders, and
strikes against the mass of concaved blades on
the waterwheel or turbine. The blades are set
across the drum of the wheel and at a slight
angle, thus giving the turbine the full benefit
of the force of the water striking against them
as well as the suction of the water after it
leaves the blades. This is known as the reaction
type of turbine and is only used in plants
where the fall of water is less than 100 feet.
There is another type of waterwheel on which
buckets take the place of blades. This is
known as the impact type and is driven entirely
by the pelting of the water against the bottom
of each cup. This wheel is used chiefly where
the fall of water is more than 100 feet.</p>

<p>“The armature of the generator is also
mounted on the shaft or axle of the turbine.
The armature, you know, is composed of coils
of wire wound very close together on an iron
frame, or spider. Since the turbine whirls
around very fast the armature is bound to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_91" id="Page_91">[91]</a></span>
turn at the same rate of speed. Now, the
armature is surrounded by electrically excited
magnets, which are the positive and negative
poles of the generator. And as the coils
of wire on the armature rush past the magnets
the attraction or lines of force between the
poles are cut abruptly and immediately electricity
is created. By means of those brass
collecting rings which you see on the armature
the coils are connected to the transmission
lines and the electricity flows through them to
the lights in Mexico City.”</p>

<p>Mr. Ryder’s description of the hydro-electric
plant was so simple and so easily understood
that Jack was able to follow the entire
process of converting water power into electrical
energy. The conversation had also
helped to lighten the rather disagreeable task
of cleaning the generator and it was midnight
almost before they realized it.</p>

<p>At this hour Mr. Ryder gave up all hope of
using the generator that night, for, as he explained
to Jack, the lights were fast being put
out in the houses and stores of Mexico City,
thus cutting down the load on the power plant<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_92" id="Page_92">[92]</a></span>
to a point where the supply could be easily furnished
by the remaining four machines. That
being the case, he suggested they quit work
and leave the task entirely to the peons
and other workmen under Nedham. Jack’s
arms were black to the elbow with dirty oil
when he finally tossed his piece of waste away,
and Mr. Ryder’s condition was little better.</p>

<p>“Come on, we’ll wash up a bit and start for
the cottage; I am rather tired and I fancy you
are too.”</p>

<p>Together they proceeded to the washroom
and a few moments later left the station building
and started up the short dusty street that
led between the two rows of cottages. The
searchlight was still playing from the roof and
here and there a lonesome sentinel could be
seen silhouetted against the skyline. Otherwise
the little community was quite lifeless.</p>

<p>Mr. Ryder’s cottage was at the very end of
the short street. It was a one-story affair
but somewhat more prepossessing in appearance
than the rest of the dwellings. The
engineer lived there entirely alone save for
Tom Why, his aged Chinese cook. In fact,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_93" id="Page_93">[93]</a></span>
each American at the plant had a separate cottage,
which was usually taken care of by some
old Indian woman. There were only two
white women in the village. One was the wife
of Allen Lyman and the other was Mrs. Harriet
Clifford, the wife of a young American
foreman in the plant-maintenance department.</p>

<p>Mr. Ryder’s cottage was no better furnished
than any of the rest. The main room, which
was living room, dining room, library and
study all in one, was equipped with several
heavy wooden chairs, a square table and a flat
desk littered with old magazines and papers.
The remaining three rooms boasted small iron
beds and washstands. Just in the rear of the
cottage was a little house in which Tom Why
and his American cookstove were quartered.
Tom was acknowledged to be the best cook
in the village, excepting, of course, the two
American women.</p>

<p>Though it was very late, Tom was up and
waiting for the engineer. He had prepared
a rather substantial midnight luncheon and
when Jack caught the odor of steaming coffee
he suddenly realized that he was extremely<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_94" id="Page_94">[94]</a></span>
hungry. Neither he nor Mr. Ryder had tasted
food since their dinner at the American Hotel
in Mexico City, and they were both ready to
do justice to Tom’s tempting spread. Between
mouthfuls, however, they did find time to talk
over the recent trouble at the plant.</p>

<p>“I must get at the bottom of this and find
out who the rebel sympathizers are. Of
course they are among the peon laborers, at
least I think so, for none of the white employees
have the slightest interest in Zapata
and his gang of cutthroats, as far as I know.
Still, the way the trouble makers have tampered
with the big switches and other dangerous
machinery that most of the peons are
afraid of, makes me believe sometimes that the
culprits are white men or natives who know a
little more about electricity than the peons.”</p>

<p>“I should think then, that you would try and
find out whether you are dealing with peons
or Mexicans of another variety,” said Jack.</p>

<p>“Find out!” demanded the engineer sharply.
“Do you think I have been sitting with my
hands folded all this time? I’ve had the place
watched. I’ve done everything I could to discover<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_95" id="Page_95">[95]</a></span>
who is up to this crooked work. You
see, after two in the morning things slacken
down at the plant. There isn’t much of a load
to be carried, only the street lighting in Mexico
City, and one or two generators are enough
to take care of that. At that time most of
the men leave the plant. There is only the
night operator and two or three watchmen in
different parts of the building, and they are
not always as alert as they might be. Well,
between two o’clock and the time the day force
comes on at six o’clock in the morning, the
meddlers get in their best work. The day
men usually discover the trouble, though in a
case like to-night, when one of the big machines
have been tampered with, the disturbance
isn’t noticed until the operator tries to
start up at nightfall.</p>

<p>“We’ve watched everything and everybody,
but when we are in one place trouble turns up
in an entirely different part of the plant. The
thing that worries me the most about the whole
business is that some night after the meddlers
have been at work the rebels out there in the
mountains might take it in their heads to attack.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_96" id="Page_96">[96]</a></span>
Suppose the searchlight generator was
crippled. In that case we’d have a serious
time, wouldn’t we? Indeed, I would like to
find out whom we are dealing with. But how
can I?”</p>

<p>“Well,” said Jack after a moment’s reflection,
“at least we can learn whether we are
dealing with peons or white men. Here’s a
suggestion. Why not sprinkle a little powder
or dust around the machines, switchboard and
other apparatus likely to be tampered with?
Sprinkle it at two o’clock every morning and
sweep it up again at six. In the meantime if
any one has tampered with these contrivances
they are bound to leave footprints. If the
prints show naked feet we’ll know it is one of
the peons, and if we find the trouble maker
wears shoes then we’ll know it is a white man.”</p>

<p>“By Jove, that’s a corking idea,” said Mr.
Ryder enthusiastically; “we’ll do it. We’ll
sprinkle cement dust on the floor. Let’s try
it out to-night and keep it up religiously until
we get an imprint of the villain’s feet. We’ll
saunter over to the plant after those workmen
clear out, which I judge will be about three<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_97" id="Page_97">[97]</a></span>
o’clock; meanwhile, if you care to, you can
snatch an hour’s sleep.”</p>

<p>To Jack sleep sounded particularly good and
as soon as Mr. Ryder pointed out his room he
tumbled into it without even removing his
shoes. But it seemed to him however that he
had only closed his eyes when he felt the engineer’s
hand upon his forehead.</p>

<p>“It’s after three o’clock,” said Mr. Ryder,
“and the workmen have all left the plant.
What do you say to setting our trap now?”</p>

<p>Jack was on his feet in an instant, for he
was as eager as the engineer to see how his
plan would work out. First they visited a
tool shed where they secured a bucket, then
Mr. Ryder ripped open a bag of cement
with his jack knife and by the light of an electric
pocket flash lamp supplied himself with a
pail of the fine gray powder.</p>

<p>As they passed the front of the plant they
could see Nedham in his office working over
some papers. They continued on around the
corner of the building where Mr. Ryder opened
a large door that let them in on the generator
floor. Two of the big machines were running,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_98" id="Page_98">[98]</a></span>
but there was not a soul in sight. Through
the glass front of the control room, high up
among the girders, they could see Lyman
watching the switchboard.</p>

<p>“Is there any wonder that the rebel sympathizers
can tamper with the machines?” said
Mr. Ryder; “there isn’t a watchman in sight,
and Lyman would not be likely to see us down
here unless he made a point of looking out of
the window, which is not necessary, for he
can see how the machines are running by looking
at the indicators on his board. Nedham
is in his office and the only other man on duty
is the engineer and he is probably in his office
watching for signals from Lyman. There
should be a watchman here on the floor, but I
guess when no one is looking he steals off and
takes a nap. I’ve fired at least five men for
doing that, but you can’t teach these Mexicans
anything. They’ll do exactly as they please
in spite of you.”</p>

<p>In fifteen minutes Jack and the engineer had
set their trap and returned to the cottage
again. They were both thoroughly tired and
Mr. Ryder began to take off his things the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_99" id="Page_99">[99]</a></span>
moment he entered the house. As he unloosened
the front of his shirt, however, a
rather bulky yellow wallet slipped out and fell
to the floor.</p>

<p>“There are those drawings,” said the
engineer. “I’d almost forgotten them with
all our activities to-day. Here’s your wallet,
I guess I won’t need it any longer.”</p>

<p>He removed the envelope of blue prints as
he spoke and opening the top drawer of his
desk dropped it inside, at the same time handing
the wallet to Jack.</p>

<p>“I’ll be up at six to look for results,” said
he as Jack started for his room, “but I really
don’t expect to find any footprints right off.
I rather think the trouble maker has done
enough damage to satisfy him for several days
at least.”</p>

<hr />

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_100" id="Page_100">[100]</a></span></p>

<h2 id="CHAPTER_X">CHAPTER X<br />
<span class="smaller">FOOTPRINTS</span></h2>

<p>In spite of the fact that he had been able
to get but a few hours’ sleep, Jack was
awake before six o’clock. The noise Mr.
Ryder made in the adjoining room aroused
him, and when he realized that the engineer
was getting ready to start for the power plant,
he dressed with all speed. But though they
were up early, old Tom Why had been awake
fully half an hour before them as a steaming
breakfast testified.</p>

<p>The two did not linger long over their
coffee, however, for they were too eager to
reach the station before the day men arrived
and tracked through the cement powder. Indeed,
they left the cottage still munching the
last of their meal. The sun had been up two
hours, but the mountains across the river were<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_101" id="Page_101">[101]</a></span>
so tall that its rays were only just getting down
into the broad valley that held Necaxa.
Jack’s first view of the place by daylight
pleased him greatly. As Mr. Ryder had said,
the country was wilderness, the only evidence
of civilization being the tracks of the narrow
gage railroad and the steel poles that carried
the four black serpent-like transmission lines
across the clearing and into the forest toward
Mexico City. Necaxa was completely shut
off from the rest of the world by mountains,
the nearest community being a little nameless
Indian village down the river.</p>

<p>However, the lad had no time to gaze at
the scenery just then, for in a few minutes the
workmen would be on the way to the plant.
Jack and Mr. Ryder hurried to the side door
they had used but three hours before, and in
a few moments they were looking at their recent
handiwork. From one machine to another
they hurried, closely inspecting the dust
on the floor, before sweeping it into the pail
again. Though they did not expect to find
traces of a nocturnal visit by the mysterious
trouble maker they were keenly alert for every<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_102" id="Page_102">[102]</a></span>
little clue. They inspected each appliance in
the main room but all seemed to be in good
order, nor did the cement powder reveal a
single telltale mark. There remained only
the small generators of the exciter sets to be
inspected. Jack hurried forward to brush up
the dust about these machines, for the men
were already entering the plant and he did not
care to let them know of the trap.</p>

<p>And as he stooped over, his eyes caught the
distinct outline of a foot close to the base of
the generator! Another and still another
were discovered close by. He could scarcely
credit his eyes. But Mr. Ryder, who was directly
behind him, saw the imprints also.</p>

<p>“By George, we’ve a clue at last!” he exclaimed,
leaning forward and examining the
tracks. “They have been made by naked feet
too! What do you think of that!”</p>

<p>“And I’ll be hanged if that isn’t the mark
of a scar on the left heel!” he ejaculated, as
he dropped to his hands and knees and scrutinized
the tracks. “Oh, our task is an easy one
now! I’ll guarantee to have the meddler in
the hands of the rurales by sundown with this<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_103" id="Page_103">[103]</a></span>
evidence to work on. But look how they have
riddled the exciter!”</p>

<p>As Jack bent closer he too could see the
mark of a scar. The foot had removed the
concrete dust completely except for a little
ridge diagonally across the heel. This showed
plainly that there had been a sharp indentation
in the flesh at that point. And as the same
mark showed in every other imprint of the
left foot there was small room for doubt.</p>

<p>“Well, it looks as if our trap had worked
far better than we expected,” he said jubilantly,
as they prepared to obliterate the track
by sweeping up the dust.</p>

<p>“Indeed it did,” replied Mr. Ryder.
“Here’s positive proof that the culprit is a
peon, and with this telltale scar to help out
it is only necessary to inspect every peon in
the plant and pick out the guilty individual.
We’ll have them lined up immediately.”</p>

<p>Together they hurried out of the station and
across to the quarters of the army officers.
The captain in command of the post was on
the front porch of his cottage washing his face
in a tin basin when Mr. Ryder interrupted him.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_104" id="Page_104">[104]</a></span>
The engineer spoke a few words in Spanish
and the officer hastily reached for a towel, at
the same time calling loudly for an orderly.
That individual arrived from behind the cottage
as if produced by magic, and after listening
to the captain’s brief orders saluted
and hurried to the barracks building, from
the door of which the soldiers were just emerging
in various stages of attire.</p>

<p>He returned presently, to be followed five
minutes later by a young officer in charge of
a squad of ten soldiers. Curt instructions
were issued by the commander and the soldiers
broke ranks immediately and went hurrying
here and there about the plant, rounding up
every peon in sight.</p>

<p>Some of the native laborers protested violently
against being hustled into line along the
south wall of the station, for they were afraid
that they were about to be shot, this being the
spot where all the executions in Necaxa were
staged. But their protests were of no avail,
for the soldiers took keen delight in hurrying
them along with the sharp point of their
bayonets or the flat stock of their guns.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_105" id="Page_105">[105]</a></span></p>

<p>In less than no time two score natives were
facing the gray stone wall. They were a
heterogeneous assortment of half-breeds and
full-blooded Indians with ragged garments
and hair long and unkempt. None wore shoes
or even sandals.</p>

<p>When every native had been located and the
line was complete the soldiers withdrew a short
distance and the captain then turning to Mr.
Ryder, spoke nervously and with great concern:</p>

<p>“Here are they, Señor, maybe now you find
them sick mans, yes.”</p>

<p>“Why did he say ‘those sick men?’” asked
Jack, somewhat puzzled.</p>

<p>“I told him there was a rumor abroad that
one of the peons had leprosy and that we
wanted to find him and put him in a pest house.
Though I know very little about the disease
I understand it shows first on the face, palms
of the hands or soles of the feet,” answered
the engineer.</p>

<p>“But why did you tell him that?” demanded
the lad.</p>

<p>“Well, for the simple reason that I do not<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_106" id="Page_106">[106]</a></span>
care to let any one know what we have discovered.
I think the less said about the scar
the easier it will be for us to catch our man.
If we keep it to ourselves he will never suspect
that we set a trap for him. Now for the
search.”</p>

<p>Mr. Ryder, Jack and the captain began a
tour of inspection. Each Indian was commanded
to lift first one foot and then the
other, while Jack and the engineer scrutinized
them closely. The engineer in addition
examined their hands and face as well,
though not with as keen an eye as he watched
the feet. The peons all submitted to the inspection
meekly, but it was quite evident from
the expression on their faces that they could
not understand the whole proceedings. One
by one they were passed and as Mr. Ryder
neared the end of the line his brow wrinkled
in a perplexed frown. Finally when the last
man was allowed to go he turned to the officer
in charge of the squad and demanded:</p>

<p>“Are these all the peons there are about the
plant? There must be more!”</p>

<p>“No more are here, Señor. But maybe<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_107" id="Page_107">[107]</a></span>
those sick mans you look on is here in the night
men. There are—ah—<i lang="es">diez hombres</i>,” said
the officer excitedly.</p>

<p>“Jack,” said the engineer, “that fellow may
be right. It is possible that my man <em>is</em> on
the night force or he may be a strange peon
who gets into the plant somehow. I think the
next move for us to make is to go down to the
Indian village and do some detective work
there. Most of the peons we hire live down
there and it is more than likely that we will find
the man with the scarred heel among them.”</p>

<p>“That sounds reasonable,” said Jack, after
considering the question. “Why not go down
there while the trail is hot?”</p>

<p>“All right,” said Mr. Ryder, “but let me
warn you that we will have to travel through
about five miles of country infested with
rebels and, as you know, they do not look upon
any of the white men from the plant with very
great favor.”</p>

<p>“I am willing to take the chance,” said Jack,
laconically.</p>

<p>“Very good, only be sure your gun is in
working order and your cartridge belt is full.”</p>

<hr />

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_108" id="Page_108">[108]</a></span></p>

<h2 id="CHAPTER_XI">CHAPTER XI<br />
<span class="smaller">SEARCHING FOR THE MAN WITH A SCARRED
HEEL</span></h2>

<p>A drove of thirty or more horses and
half as many pack mules were quartered
in the large corral behind the barracks
for the use of the rurales stationed at Necaxa.
From among them a rather docile mustang
was selected for Jack. While a native was
saddling the horse, a <i lang="es">mozo</i>, or Indian servant,
arrived with the engineer’s steed, a beautiful
creature that had cost Mr. Ryder nearly three
hundred Mexican dollars, which is a very high
price indeed to pay for horse flesh in that country.
Three of the rurales were detailed to accompany
them as a special guard and before
leaving the enclosure the entire party made a
careful inspection of their firearms.</p>

<p>For the first two miles the trail skirted the
high bank of the river and was wide enough<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_109" id="Page_109">[109]</a></span>
to permit the men to ride two abreast. The
three soldier-policemen took the lead while
Jack and the engineer brought up the rear,
and as their horses jogged along Mr. Ryder
explained briefly the life of the Mexican Indians
since the conquest of the country by adventurers
from across the sea.</p>

<p>“These natives,” he said, “have been veritable
slaves since their ancestors yielded to
Spain’s warriors. The peons, who are all Indians
or half-breeds, are the lowest type of
Mexicans. They are uneducated and uncivilized
and for that reason they rarely advance
above the class of servants and laborers.
Since the day they were conquered they have
been without opportunity, however, so we cannot
blame them altogether for their condition.
There is every reason to believe, from the
relics that are left to-day, that the Mexican
Indians were semi-civilized at least. They
erected magnificent temples, they laid out large
cities, and they even built aqueducts and sewer
systems. Indeed, they were much farther advanced
than the North American Indian of
the plains, but with the advent of the Spaniards<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_110" id="Page_110">[110]</a></span>
they began to deteriorate for the simple reason
that they were not allowed to progress.
As you already know, a man or a nation cannot
stand still. It must either develop or retrogress.
The Spaniards made slaves of the
Indians and while they are not slaves in name
to-day they might just as well be, for they have
not as much freedom as the negro had in the
United States before the Civil War.</p>

<p>“The peons live as tenants on <i lang="es">haciendas</i>,
or large farms, where they till the soil and
raise crops. For this work they are paid a
few <i lang="es">centavos</i> a day which in American money
does not amount to five cents; with this
pittance they are supposed to buy food and
clothes. But the hacienda owners sell them
food and clothes at a figure far above their
daily earnings and as a result the Indian is
always in debt to his master. And since it is
a capital offense in Mexico for an employee to
leave an employer while still in debt to him,
the peon is bound to the hacienda on which he
is born for the rest of his life. He can never
leave and he can never cease working for the
same man. Whole communities of natives<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_111" id="Page_111">[111]</a></span>
are often controlled in this way by Mexican
farmers.”</p>

<p>“It seems ridiculous that such conditions can
exist to-day,” said Jack, very much surprised
at this revelation. He had always considered
the Mexican Indian as a shiftless being who
did not work and lived from hand to mouth
simply because of his own laziness.</p>

<p>“Do not get the idea that these natives are
blind to their present condition or that they
do not care to elevate their general plane of
existence,” continued Mr. Ryder. “They are
just as eager for a chance to advance as is the
Jew or other foreigner who immigrates to
America. That is the reason why the present
revolution is being waged in the north by
Carranza and Villa, and that is why our bloodthirsty
friend Zapata has so many peon followers.</p>

<p>“The only trouble is the moment one of
these revolutions is successful and the new
leader is in power all pledges to the peon are
forgotten and the native goes back to exactly
the same condition that he has been fighting
to clear himself from. It is a very unhappy<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_112" id="Page_112">[112]</a></span>
situation, but some day, perhaps, a leader will
keep his promise to his people. Then the huge
<i lang="es">haciendas</i>, which often embrace hundreds of
thousands of acres, will be confiscated and
this land with the millions of acres of government
land will be cut up into small farms and
sold to the natives at reasonable terms exactly
as our country opened up the great West.
When this happens Mexico will develop into
a wonderful nation. Give these people public
schools and the other advantages of civilization
and you will soon see what kind of stuff
they are made of. The old Indian blood is
strong in them and Indians, properly trained,
often make excellent men.”</p>

<p>Mr. Ryder’s talk had changed Jack’s opinion
of the peons a great deal. Indeed, he soon
found that instead of despising them he was
sympathizing with them. He could not understand,
however, how the engineer could
feel kindly disposed to the natives when they
were causing him so much trouble. He was
on the point of mentioning this thought when
Mr. Ryder spoke again.</p>

<p>“I feel very sorry for the peons even though<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_113" id="Page_113">[113]</a></span>
I am an agent of Huerta. But as I have
weighed it out, my duty to my employer comes
first no matter whether the employer is a scoundrel
or not. It is not for me to judge. I am
asked to keep Mexico City illuminated and I
will keep the lights burning no matter who is
in the National Palace, and, moreover, I’ll do
it in spite of this man with the scarred foot,
whoever he is.”</p>

<p>Thus recalled to their mission, Jack instantly
became attentive to their surroundings.
He found that the trail had narrowed
and that the rurales ahead had formed in single
file. His little mustang was patiently picking
its way through rough places and underbrush
to keep beside the animal ridden by the
engineer.</p>

<p>“I guess we have been talking too much and
paying too little attention to our horses, Jack,”
said Mr. Ryder. “Push ahead and get in single
file. This is a section of the trail that
carries us over the shoulder of a mountain and
it is rather narrow.”</p>

<p>Soon the shoulder was topped, however, and
the horses began to descend in single file toward<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_114" id="Page_114">[114]</a></span>
the Indian village. The community was
somewhat larger than the villages Jack had
seen from the train window on his way to
Mexico City, otherwise it was the same collection
of dilapidated huts that looked as if they
had been literally thrown together by their
builders.</p>

<p>As they drove down through the single
street a regiment of barking dogs and screaming
naked Indian children greeted them.
Robust, dark-skinned men lounged about before
the huts (most of them clad in pajama like
cotton garments), while their women folk
worked hard at grinding corn between stones
or carried water from the river in tall earthen
jugs which they balanced deftly on their
heads. Down at the river bank Jack could
see other women busy washing clothes. This
laundry work was accomplished by pounding
the garments between stones much to the detriment
of the garments, for the hard stones
rubbed innumerable holes in the cloth as Jack
found later when he gave his linen to a native
washerwoman.</p>

<p>In the village Mr. Ryder took the lead and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_115" id="Page_115">[115]</a></span>
Jack followed, leaving the rurales to their own
diversions. The engineer drove toward a
more pretentious hut than the rest, where a
very much wrinkled old Indian sat sunning
himself before the door and idly watching a
half dozen scrawny razorback pigs rooting in
the dirt almost at his very feet.</p>

<p>The two Americans reined up before the
house and viewed the picture that the old fellow
made as he sat there staring absently at
the animals.</p>

<p>“That,” said Mr. Ryder, “is Señor Yuai and
his pigs. Pigs and vultures, as you know, are
the scavengers of Mexico. But for their able
services the country would be unfit to live in
because of its filth and carrion. And Señor
Yuai, though he is neither pig nor vulture, is
also a very useful inhabitant. He is the Indian
doctor who attends to all the natives in
this vicinity. The old fellow is very much
looked up to and every one comes to him for
advice. He is aged and very nearsighted but
his mind is as keen as ever. He knows every
peon for miles around and I’ve an idea that
he can identify our trouble maker with the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_116" id="Page_116">[116]</a></span>
scarred foot if he wants to. Come, we’ll hear
what he has to say on the question.”</p>

<p>The Americans dismounted and after kicking
their way through the drove of grunting
pigs confronted the austere old Indian. Señor
Yuai peered up at them with eyes bleared by
age and demanded in Spanish to know whose
shadow fell across his doorway. (The following
conversation then took place which
Mr. Ryder translated for Jack’s benefit.)</p>

<p>“It is I, Señor Ryder, from the electrical
plant,” said the engineer.</p>

<p>“Gringo friend come over mountain to see
me?” asked the old Indian.</p>

<p>“Yes, I’ve come to see you, Señor Yuai, but
not because I am sick of <i lang="es">calentura</i>. It is another
reason. Tell me, in all your years do
you remember a peon ailing of a cut heel.
Did you ever cure a very deep wound that
would leave a scar across a peon’s heel, thus?”
Mr. Ryder illustrated his question by drawing
his finger diagonally across the old man’s heel.
The Indian was silent a long time and while
his memory went slowly back over the many
years he had been doctoring the natives, Mr.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_117" id="Page_117">[117]</a></span>
Ryder slipped a cigarette between his lean old
fingers, saying, “Here, Señor Yuai, perhaps a
little smoke will make you remember better.”</p>

<p>The Indian accepted the roll of brown paper
and tobacco with a grunt of satisfaction and
lit it on the glowing end of Mr. Ryder’s own
cigarette which the engineer held for his convenience.</p>

<p>For five minutes the old native puffed in
silence, exhaling great clouds of blue smoke
from time to time. Finally he spoke.</p>

<p>“As many years ago as I have fingers came
a young man to see me. He had stepped on
a <i lang="es">machette</i> and the flesh of his foot was laid
open to the bone. My medicine cured him.
Soon he could walk, he could run, he could
swim. He was a fine big fellow. He could
shoot well, he could ride well and he was a
good boy except he liked <i lang="es">pulque</i> too much.
One day he went away. Two summers later
he came back in clothes as green as the banana
palm. He was then a rurale. He went away
again and never came again. His name—ah—his
name went with him.” Here the Indian
touched his forehead with his finger as<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_118" id="Page_118">[118]</a></span>
he spoke and this action told the American
plainer than his words that he had forgotten
the young man’s name.</p>

<p>Jack and the engineer looked at each other
significantly when Señor Yuai finished speaking.</p>

<p>“Can it be that we have traitors among our
rurales!” demanded Mr. Ryder incredulously.</p>

<hr />

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_119" id="Page_119">[119]</a></span></p>

<h2 id="CHAPTER_XII">CHAPTER XII<br />
<span class="smaller">THE DRAWINGS ARE STOLEN</span></h2>

<p>“Well, this is a mighty serious state of
affairs,” said the engineer as they returned
to their horses and prepared to remount.</p>

<p>“Yes, indeed, and from all appearances we
have a real enemy to contend with,” replied
the lad.</p>

<p>“You are right, we have,” confirmed Mr.
Ryder. “If our man with the scarred foot is
a member of the rurales, we are going to have
the devil’s own job locating him too. We cannot
accuse at random and moreover we cannot
take our troubles to the captain, for the
reason that where there is one traitor there
are likely to be many more. The captain may
be a revolutionist himself, and if he is, heaven
help us when he finds out that we have a way
of identifying the trouble maker. We would<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_120" id="Page_120">[120]</a></span>
be murdered in less than a week. I think we
had better feel our way very slowly before we
make an arrest.”</p>

<p>“But why should a rurale go traveling
about in his bared feet at night?” queried
Jack, suddenly discovering a puzzling question.</p>

<p>“I thought of that myself,” confessed the
engineer, “and the only reason I can give is
that the culprit is always afraid that the jingle
of his big spurs will attract attention and
rather than remove them he removed his boots
instead and goes about his work silently.
That sounds perfectly plausible, doesn’t it?”</p>

<p>“By George, that’s capital reasoning! I believe
you’ve hit it exactly right,” exclaimed the
lad enthusiastically.</p>

<p>“I see our three guards over on the river
bank,” said Mr. Ryder, abruptly changing the
subject; “we’ll drive over and join them there,
for I’ve an idea that our horses could stand
a drink before starting for the plant again.</p>

<p>“And by the way,” he warned as they urged
their mounts forward, “I wouldn’t say much
about our friend of the scarred foot in the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_121" id="Page_121">[121]</a></span>
presence of the rurales either here or at the
plant, for you never can tell just how much
English some of these fellows understand.
I’m a little worried over the impression that
our search among the peons created, even
though I did tell the captain the falsehood
about the suspected leper. Who knows, perhaps
the very man we are after was looking on
all the time. In that case our lives are in
danger every moment. He would kill us rather
than run the chance of being identified.”</p>

<p>It was quite evident to Jack that the engineer
regarded the business at hand as rather
hazardous and the lad from Vermont could
not help feeling slightly concerned about his
own safety. He put on a bold front before
Mr. Ryder, however, for he did not care to
have the engineer think that he was the least
bit worried.</p>

<p>The river’s course through the valley was
broad and the stream ran sluggish and shallow
where it passed the village. Indeed, just below
the point where the women were washing
on the rocks was a ford, with a sloping
sandy beach on either bank. Here it was that<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_122" id="Page_122">[122]</a></span>
the pack trains leaving the valley toward the
north crossed the stream. On the bank opposite,
Jack saw several large alligators sunning
themselves, and here and there on the surface
of the water he also saw the scaly backs
and heads of others that had come up to rest
awhile and get a fresh supply of air. Some of
them were fully ten feet long.</p>

<p>But in spite of the presence of these reptiles,
the horses did not hesitate to wade belly deep
into the stream and cool themselves while they
slaked their thirst. Jack noticed this and remarked
about it to Mr. Ryder.</p>

<p>“Alligators are not disposed to attack anything
very large,” said the engineer, “although
sometimes they do make away with sheep and
small calves that come down for a drink.
The ’gator is not as ferocious as his cousin the
crocodile and I have never heard of any natives
being devoured by one, in spite of the
fact that the Indians wade the ford here
daily.”</p>

<p>Mr. Ryder had hardly finished speaking
when a young Indian appeared on the opposite
bank followed by a full-grown hound dog.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_123" id="Page_123">[123]</a></span>
The native was clad only in abbreviated canvas
trousers and slung across his back was a
tiny mail bag. Jack learned later that his
first name was Miguel and that his last name
was almost unpronounceable, also that he was
the official runner, or messenger, of that section
of the country, and that his forefathers
had been runners as far back as the days of
Montezuma.</p>

<p>The native stood knee deep in the river a
moment and emitted several loud whoops at
the same time churning the water furiously
with his feet. At this the alligators on the
bank slipped into the water with a splash and
every scaly back and head disappeared. Then
the Indian plunged into the stream and waded
across, at the same time coaxing the dog to
follow. The hound stood whining at the
water’s edge, however, and the messenger
reached the opposite shore before the animal
found sufficient courage to follow. Finally,
after much coaxing, he took the plunge and
swam toward his master. But he had scarcely
passed the middle of the stream when he began
to whine again, half raising himself out<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_124" id="Page_124">[124]</a></span>
of the water with his frantic efforts to swim
faster. The next instant there was a swirl
just behind him and an ugly head appeared on
the surface. The dog fairly leapt out of the
water at this but he could not avoid the reptile
whose dripping jaws closed upon one hind
leg.</p>

<p>The native shouted wildly and plunged back
into the river again to rescue his pet. But before
he had gone two steps, Jack, with great
presence of mind, whipped out his revolver.
Twice he fired and each bullet found its way
into the scaly body. Instantly the water was
lashed into foam by the death struggle of the
monster. The great jaws opened wide and
the reptile awoke the echoes in the hills with
a bellow like that of an angry bull. Then it
sank out of sight.</p>

<p>Half drowned and with one leg dangling
limp and useless the hound dragged itself from
the river. The young Indian lifted it in his
arms and caressed it gently, at the same time
talking effusively to Jack. Of course the
American could not understand the messenger,
but it was quite evident from the expression<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_125" id="Page_125">[125]</a></span>
on the red man’s face that he was very grateful
to Jack and that he admired his quick and
accurate shooting.</p>

<p>“What is he saying?” asked the Vermonter,
turning to Mr. Ryder.</p>

<p>“He says that you are a very good marksman
and that you have a warm heart for a
gringo. He promises never to forget your
kindness.”</p>

<p>Jack smiled his acknowledgment and prepared
to remount his horse, which with the
others had withdrawn from the river when the
struggling alligator began its frenzied lashing
of the water.</p>

<p>It was past midday when the five riders
started on their return journey toward the
power plant, and the heat was intense. However,
as soon as the horses had climbed out of
the valley the trail led through a dense forest
where huge trees and thickly matted vines shut
out all sunlight and all heat as well. Travel,
under such circumstances was thoroughly enjoyable,
and the five riders swung along in
single file until they reached the open country
in the vicinity of the great hydro station again.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_126" id="Page_126">[126]</a></span></p>

<p>“Well,” said Jack as he reined in beside
Mr. Ryder at the gate in the barbed-wire barricade,
“I thought you said the woods were
full of rebels. We haven’t seen a sign of one
all day long. What do you make of it?”</p>

<p>“It is more than likely that they are off in
some other section of the hills, burning and
pillaging. But don’t think that they haven’t
an eye on us, for they have and you’ll see signs
of them again before long, I’ll warrant.”</p>

<p>The soldier on guard at the gate had unfastened
the intricate lock by this time and the
cavalcade entered. The rurales hurried off at
top speed to their long low barracks hall where
they hoped to find the remains of the noonday
mess. And as for Jack and the engineer,
they were not slow in reaching the cottage, for
they knew that faithful old Tom Why had
something tempting waiting for them.</p>

<p>A <i lang="es">mozo</i> met them as they reined in before
the door and when they had dismounted he
took charge of the horses. The few hours in
the saddle had been rather tiresome to the lad,
for he was not accustomed to that form of
exercise. Indeed, the shaking up he had received<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_127" id="Page_127">[127]</a></span>
on horseback and the lack of sleep the
night before had made him so thoroughly fatigued
that even the cartridge belt and holster
weighed heavily on his hips and as he walked
toward the cottage he started to unbuckle the
leather girdle. Just as he was mounting the
steps the buckle opened suddenly and the belt
swung free, upsetting the holster and toppling
the revolver to the ground.</p>

<p>Hastily Jack stooped to pick it up. But as
he reached down he caught sight of a naked
footprint in the dust! He bent closer, hardly
able to believe what he saw! The footprint
bore the mark of a deep scar diagonally across
the heel!</p>

<p>“Hi! Mr. Ryder! Look! Our man with
the scar paid a visit here as well!” he shouted
to the engineer, who had already entered the
cottage.</p>

<p>Mr. Ryder hurried out and examined the
footprint with Jack.</p>

<p>“By George, you’re right! What could he
have wanted up here!” exclaimed the engineer.</p>

<p>Jack did not wait to answer the question.
He bolted into the house and rushed to the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_128" id="Page_128">[128]</a></span>
flat-topped desk, for he had suddenly thought
of the precious blueprints. Eagerly he drew
open the top drawer into which he had seen
Mr. Ryder drop the yellow envelope the evening
before. But the compartment was empty!
The drawings were gone!</p>

<hr />

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_129" id="Page_129">[129]</a></span></p>

<h2 id="CHAPTER_XIII">CHAPTER XIII<br />
<span class="smaller">A WEAKENED GARRISON</span></h2>

<p>With the disappearance of the engineer’s
drawings the mystery that surrounded
the man with the scarred foot was doubled.
Neither Jack nor Mr. Ryder could be quite
positive of the clue they had been following.
To them the fact that the trouble maker went
about without shoes argued that he was a
peon, and they could well understand why a
peon, imbued with the spirit of revolution,
should seek to make conditions as uncomfortable
as possible for President Huerta, against
whose rule they were revolting. That the
person in question should undertake to wreck
the power plant, or portions of it, seemed quite
natural. But when it came to stealing drawings
that were absolutely useless to them the
whole affair took on a different complexion.</p>

<p>Who was this individual with the scar on<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_130" id="Page_130">[130]</a></span>
his foot? Was he a peon or was he some one
of the other employees about the plant? Or
again, was he a soldier, or a member of the
band of rurales, or was he some one of the
bandits in the mountains who ran the guard
at night and accomplished his trickery under
the very eyes of soldiers and employees? The
whole situation was thoroughly muddled and
Jack and Mr. Ryder spent days trying to fathom
the knotty problem. To a technical man
the drawings were of the utmost value, for
they laid bare to him the secret of an invention
that would make him wealthy. But on the
other hand it would seem that the man was
moved more by his sympathies with the revolutionists
than by his desire for personal gain,
since it was quite apparent that the person
who was so industriously engaged in making
things disagreeable for President Huerta and
the man who stole the drawings was the same
individual.</p>

<p>“It is a mighty peculiar situation,” said Mr.
Ryder one evening, after he and Jack had been
puzzling over the matter for several hours.
“This is my only conclusion. The man must<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_131" id="Page_131">[131]</a></span>
be a peon, or a soldier, for they are the only
persons hereabout who are interested in the
revolution at all. He has heard of the drawings
somehow, and believing that they would
be of value to Zapata or Carranza (or whoever
else he favors), he stole them. Later on he
will probably turn them over to some one of
these leaders with the hope, perhaps, that he
will be given a commission or some other form
of recognition for his service to the cause.</p>

<p>“But after I have reached that conclusion,”
he added, “I am not absolutely certain that I
am shooting in the right direction.”</p>

<p>For some time after the disappearance of
the papers everything ran smoothly at the
plant. But in the meantime disconcerting rumors
were coming in from the mountains
about bands of Zapatistas who were gathering
at all points. The rurales who went out
to patrol the hills and in particular to ride the
transmission line to see that it was not disturbed
were the first to bring in reports of
skirmishes with these rebels. Almost daily
several of the soldier-policemen would locate
a handful of armed natives somewhere in the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_132" id="Page_132">[132]</a></span>
hills. Always a fight followed which resulted
in at least one or two fatalities. More than
once these green-clad riders came into Necaxa
with dead or wounded comrades in their arms.
And on several occasions they appeared at the
power plant with prisoners bound hand and
foot and tied to the backs of horses or burros
like so many sacks of flour.</p>

<p>Short work was made of these men. Their
fate was sealed the moment they were captured
by the rurales. As a matter of form
they were given a drumhead trial; that is,
they were taken before the chief officer of the
rurales and asked a number of unimportant
questions. No matter how these questions
were answered the sentence was the same.
The natives were always condemned to be shot
at sunrise the following morning.</p>

<p>Jack was present at the trial of one of these
unfortunates and after the rebel was taken to
the guardhouse the lad and Mr. Ryder went
to visit him. It gave Jack a rather uncanny
feeling when he realized that the man with
whom they were talking would be dead and
cold in ten hours. The Vermonter was up before<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_133" id="Page_133">[133]</a></span>
sunrise to see the prisoner led out and
placed against the gray wall of the power
plant. The firing squad was composed of five
men and an officer who stood with sword
drawn while a soldier bound a handkerchief
about the eyes of the victim. When this was
done the executioners took careful aim and
waited for the abrupt command to fire.</p>

<p>The five guns roared simultaneously, and
Jack grew sick as he saw the blindfolded figure
sway backward first, then recover its balance
only to pitch forward with a groan and become
an inert and lifeless mass. When the smoke
had cleared away the officer walked calmly up
to the dead man and drawing his revolver
emptied the entire six chambers into the already
lifeless body. This, Jack learned, was
prescribed by the military regulations of
Mexico, which state that an officer in charge
of a firing squad, is held responsible for the
certain death of the victim.</p>

<p>The rurales, however, were not the only
ones to bring in word of the gathering of the
Zapatistas. One day three men left the plant
on a handcar trip of inspection along the narrow<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_134" id="Page_134">[134]</a></span>
gage railroad track. One took a Winchester
rifle with him while the others carried
their revolvers. On their return journey
they were met at a bend in the road by six
rebels. One had a rifle but the others were
armed only with <i lang="es">machettes</i>, or long brush knives.
The men from the plant were ordered to stop,
of course, but they did not obey. Instead they
started to pump the handles harder and since
the tracks were down grade at that point
their car had gained tremendous headway
by the time they reached the natives. Fortunately
the peons had not had forethought
enough to plug the railroad tracks or loosen a
rail in which case the car would have been
wrecked and the inspectors killed immediately.
As it was they ran past the natives at top
speed. The Mexican with the rifle opened
fire and the man with the Winchester replied,
but he was only able to get in one shot before
the handle of the car knocked the rifle from
his grasp. One of the other men drew his six
shooter and emptied it as he went flying past.
It was a narrow escape and the three inspectors<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_135" id="Page_135">[135]</a></span>
were glad when they reached the power
plant.</p>

<p>Shortly after this experience some excitement
was created at the station when Lyman
noticed that one of his indicators recorded a
grounded transmission line. Two linemen
and a squad of rurales were despatched to locate
the trouble. Five miles back in the mountains
they found a dead peon clinging to one
of the steel transmission poles and the story
of the ground was revealed instantly. This
peon had climbed the pole and with his steel
<i lang="es">machette</i> tried to cut through one of the transmission
lines. The moment the blade came in
contact with the cable a circuit was formed and
the entire 88,000 volts were sent through the
man’s body. His companions, seeing his fate,
had fled without even attempting to rescue
him.</p>

<p>These demonstrations on the part of the
rebels did not add to the peace of mind of the
men at the power plant. Indeed every one
began to feel the strain, for the station was
veritably in a state of siege. Rumors came<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_136" id="Page_136">[136]</a></span>
into Necaxa by way of the peons from the
Indian village down the valley, that José
Cerro, one of the fiercest of the mountain
bandits and a strong ally of Zapata, was in
charge of the horde that was gathering in the
hills in that vicinity. After that no one felt
inclined to leave the station except when accompanied
by a guard of rurales and all inspection
of railroad and transmission lines
was done with the aid of soldiers.</p>

<p>Then one day in the midst of it all the officer
in charge of the infantry reported to Mr.
Ryder that he had been in communication with
General Rodriguez and had received orders
to move his entire detachment back to Mexico
City. The engineer could not believe his ears.
With all haste he called up the capital on the
long-distance telephone.</p>

<p>“Why, you won’t need soldiers out there any
longer,” said the military officer after the
engineer had protested vigorously to the removal
of the guard. “You don’t need soldiers
because Zapata is moving his whole army
toward the Atlantic coast. He’s evidently
heard of the shipment of arms coming in on<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_137" id="Page_137">[137]</a></span>
the German steamer and hopes to intercept
them on their way to the capital. If he takes
the railroad we are lost. That’s why we want
your soldiers. We must have them. The
rebel chief has withdrawn all his men from
your section of the country so I’m sure you
won’t need them.”</p>

<p>“Oh, is that so,” said Mr. Ryder, thoroughly
angry. “Well, there are a few hundred lurking
out here in the woods just now and I am
expecting an attack almost any time.”</p>

<p>“You are mistaken, I am sure,” said the
officer; “there may be a few bandits about in
the mountains but the Zapatistas have all followed
their leader. I am very sorry, but we
need all the soldiers you have at Necaxa.
However, if you are at all alarmed I will leave
you a detachment of twenty-five infantrymen
who, with the squad of rurales you have stationed
there, will be able to defend the place
against a few bandits. Good-by.”</p>

<p>The soldiers entrained that very afternoon,
much to the chagrin of Mr. Ryder and the
other Americans.</p>

<p>“By George, this is the queerest piece of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_138" id="Page_138">[138]</a></span>
work I have ever seen,” said Mr. Ryder.
“If Zapata has moved his men, José Cerro
did not follow his leader, for he’s out there in
the mountains with two hundred men and he’ll
swoop down on us in short order when he
hears how weak our garrison is. Just watch
how bold those greasers get when they learn
that the infantry has been called back to Mexico
City.”</p>

<h2 id="CHAPTER_XIV">CHAPTER XIV<br />
<span class="smaller">THE NIGHT WATCH</span></h2>

<p>Mr. Ryder’s prediction came true. It
was not two days later when a half
dozen peons appeared on the edge of the forest
and occupied their time shooting out the
windows in the workmen’s cottages and sending
leaden greetings to any one who appeared
out of doors. They remained in their positions
until the soldiers mounted a light machine
gun in the window of the barracks house
and poured a rain of steel-jacketed bullets in
their direction. But José Cerro’s followers
were not the only ones who were made bold
by the withdrawal of the troops. The traitor
inside the power plant became active too.</p>

<p>One evening while Jack and Mr. Ryder were
partaking of one of Tom Why’s elaborate
meals, Phil Underwood, the young American
whose duty it was to take care of the huge<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_140" id="Page_140">[140]</a></span>
searchlight, rushed into the dining room.</p>

<p>“Mr. Ryder,” he exclaimed with a savage
note in his voice, “there’s a peon in Necaxa I’d
like to lay hands on. He’s that blasted sympathizer.
If I knew who he was I’d choke
him to death. What do you think he’s done
now to help that bunch of cutthroats out there
in the mountain? He’s put the big searchlight
out of business! He’s wrecked the entire
outfit and there isn’t a place this side of
New York where we can get the broken parts
replaced! It looks as if we were up against
it for sure.”</p>

<p>The engineer looked thoroughly worried.</p>

<p>“When did it happen?” he demanded.</p>

<p>“The light was all right up to dawn this
morning. I shut it off promptly at four
o’clock, put the canvas jacket over it and went
to bed. When I tried to start it a few moments
ago I found the whole mechanism gone
to smash.”</p>

<p>For a long time Mr. Ryder was silent. His
brow was wrinkled and it was evident to both
Phil and Jack that the situation was causing
him some deep thought. Finally he spoke.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_141" id="Page_141">[141]</a></span></p>

<p>“Look here, Phil, this condition is mighty
serious and I am at a loss to know exactly how
to proceed. I think the best plan is not to
mention this last piece of treachery. Merely
go to Lieutenant Hernandez and tell him that
the searchlight suddenly became out of order
and until we can repair it or make better arrangements
he must keep a double guard along
the barricade and the first trench. If we
spread the news about this broadcast we can’t
tell what sort of an effect it will have on the
soldiers. Mexicans are a peculiar lot, you
know, and for that reason alone I think it
would be far better for us to keep this incident
secret. In the meantime you and Jack
and myself can keep a watchful eye on everything
in general and I’ll try to work out a plan
for an improvised searchlight.”</p>

<p>“Very good, sir,” said Phil, as he hurried
off to the military barracks.</p>

<p>When the youth had gone Mr. Ryder turned
to Jack and said: “I trust you are still willing
to help me in this difficulty, my boy.”</p>

<p>“You’re right I am,” exclaimed Jack enthusiastically,
“I am as much interested as if<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_142" id="Page_142">[142]</a></span>
I were employed here and I’ll do anything I
can to be of assistance.”</p>

<p>“Very well then, Jack, I’ll look to you to do
a man’s share of the watching around here
until we can get things straightened out.
This trouble with the searchlight may mean
that a night attack is impending. I purpose
doing some guard duty myself to-night and I
should like to have you help me out. Will
you?”</p>

<p>“Only tell me what you want of me and I’ll
do it without a word of protest,” said Jack
loyally.</p>

<p>“Well, suppose you buckle on your revolver
now and start patroling the village. Keep an
eye out for anything that does not look absolutely
normal. At midnight report back to the
cottage here and wake me up. I’ll do my trick
between midnight and dawn, for I do not intend
that this traitor shall get in any more of
his underhanded work without being caught
at it.”</p>

<p>“That’s a capital scheme,” said the young
Vermonter and finishing his coffee he hurried
to his room. There he secured his belt and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_143" id="Page_143">[143]</a></span>
holster which he had tossed on his bed an hour
previous. Also before he left he rummaged
through his traveling bag until he had located
a tiny electric pocket flash lamp which he had
brought with him all the way from Drueryville.
Ten minutes later he was sauntering
down the single narrow street toward the
power plant.</p>

<p>Darkness was just coming on as the sentries
were changed and the lad watched the small
squad of regulars leave the barracks and take
their places at various points around the tiny
village.</p>

<p>“I wonder,” mused the boy, “how many actually
keep awake all night? I’ll warrant half
of them find some sheltered spot and go to
sleep after midnight.”</p>

<p>For an hour or two the little community resembled
the quarry towns of far off Vermont
to such a degree that Jack actually became a
little homesick as he viewed the scene. Every
cottage window glowed with cheerful light and
the day men, free from their tasks for a while,
were indulging in the only sociability Necaxa
afforded: that was to gather in twos and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_144" id="Page_144">[144]</a></span>
threes on cottage porches and spend the evening
in telling stories and smoking. Now and
then some one of these groups would burst
forth in songs and what the tunes lacked in
harmony was made up for in the enthusiasm of
the singers. Most of the songs Jack recognized
as having been popular back in the States
two years before.</p>

<p>At half past nine the groups began to
dwindle, the men going off to their various
cottages. One by one the lights went out and
by ten o’clock the place was in total darkness,
save for the lights in the power plant. Jack
felt very lonesome then. Except for the
steady grumble of the generators inside the
big gray building, not a sound disturbed the
stillness. From place to place about the village
the youth roamed, peering here and there
for signs of trouble. But mostly he watched
in the vicinity of the power plant.</p>

<p>This constant vigil was very tiresome, however,
and several times he paused in a secluded
angle of the building and flashed his electric
lamp on the face of his watch. He was thoroughly<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_145" id="Page_145">[145]</a></span>
glad when the hands pointed out the
hour of midnight.</p>

<p>He made one more tour of inspection after
that, then started up the street toward Mr.
Ryder’s cottage. He had almost reached his
destination when suddenly his attention was
attracted by a gray shadow moving between
two cottages some distance to his left. Jack
remembered that both buildings were occupied
by Mexican linemen and his suspicions
were aroused immediately. As softly as a
panther he moved across the roadway and
gained the corner of one of the buildings.
The shadow still lingered in the alley and the
youth softly slipped his revolver from its holster.
But just as he was on the point of calling
to the man to throw up his hands he became
aware of another gray shadow moving
about. This one was coming stealthily up the
roadway he had just left and Jack thanked his
lucky stars that he had hidden himself when
he did.</p>

<p>It was quite evident to the Vermonter that
the two shadows intended to meet, but in order<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_146" id="Page_146">[146]</a></span>
to accomplish this either one or the other
must pass within six feet of him. For a moment
he scarcely knew what to do, for he realized
that he could not handle two men at once.</p>

<p>The man in the alley had paused, but the one
in the roadway came forward softly and
swiftly. When he was within fifteen feet of
the crouching youth Jack could see him quite
distinctly. He wore a very broad hat and the
tight jacket of a rurale. Of a rurale! Instantly
the old Indian doctor’s story about a
rurale with an injured foot flashed upon him!
This must be the man of the scarred heel!</p>

<p>Throwing all caution to the wind, Jack
dropped his revolver and leapt toward the
shadowy figure. It was a perfect flying tackle
and the man came down with a crash, his legs
pinned tightly together, exactly as Jack had
pinned the legs of many an opposing fullback
on the field at Drueryville.</p>

<p>The attack was so sudden that the man lay
stunned for a moment. Then as if he suddenly
realized that it was a human being and
not a vice that had gripped him, the soldier began
to struggle. He tried to kick and squirm<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_147" id="Page_147">[147]</a></span>
his way out of the boy’s arms, at the same time
thrashing about with his fists and cursing
lustily in Spanish. He was a big man and exceedingly
powerful and Jack had all that he
could do to hold him on the ground.</p>

<p>The lad had the advantage, however, since
the native was almost flat on his stomach. By
careful maneuvering and the help of two or
three wrestling holds that are known to every
American boy he was soon able to work himself
astride the prostrated one and pin the
refractory hands down as well. This accomplished,
the youth began to shout for help at
the top of his voice.</p>

<p>Mr. Ryder was first on the scene. He came
running across from his cottage, a revolver in
one hand and an electric flash lamp in the
other. The Mexican linemen came tumbling
out of their cottages a few moments later and
immediately after two Mexican regulars arrived,
all out of breath.</p>

<p>“Well, I think we’ve captured our man,” said
Jack, panting in his excitement. “Here, lay
hold of this fellow, so I can stand up.”</p>

<p>The soldiers seized the prostrated one but<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_148" id="Page_148">[148]</a></span>
they still kept him pinned flat on his stomach,
in spite of his protests.</p>

<p>“Mr. Ryder,” said Jack, “I think this is
the man with the scarred foot. Turn your
light this way until we have a good look at
his feet. He hasn’t any boots on, that’s certain,
for he moved about like a cat.”</p>

<p>Hurriedly the engineer turned the light on
the native’s naked feet and there, standing out
plainly in spite of the dirt and dust, was a
long scar that extended across the heel and
partly up the side of his foot toward the ankle.
The wound looked exactly as if the man had at
one time stepped on a very sharp stone that
had laid the flesh open to the bone.</p>

<p>“By George, you’re right! He’s our man!”
exclaimed the engineer jubilantly. Then to
the soldiers in Spanish he said:</p>

<p>“Hustle him off to the guardhouse, men, and
put a double watch over him, for he’s a traitor.
I’ll pay a peso a day to the men who watch
him, but I’ll have the scoundrel shot who lets
him get away.”</p>

<p>Without any ceremony the regulars jerked
the big man to his feet and marched him off<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_149" id="Page_149">[149]</a></span>
down the street, Mr. Ryder and Jack following
directly behind with their revolvers cocked
and ready for action. But the heavy door to
the prison pen had hardly been bolted behind
the rurale when the town was aroused by another
sensation. From down along the line
of barbed wire fence came the sharp report of
a rifle. The first report was followed by two
others in quick succession.</p>

<p>“What is it! An attack!” gasped Jack as
he rushed forward with Mr. Ryder. The
sound of firing aroused every man in the camp
and in an instant half-clad soldiers and workmen
came tumbling from barracks hall and
cottage.</p>

<p>“An attack! an attack!” was the cry they all
uttered as they hurried into the trenches.</p>

<p>But after the third shot the sentry’s guns
were silent so long that Mr. Ryder and Jack
and Lieutenant Hernandez and Captain
Alvarez went to investigate.</p>

<p>“What was the trouble?” they demanded of
the first soldier they met.</p>

<p>“Shadows came along the fence. Three,
four, five of them all came to try and cut the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_150" id="Page_150">[150]</a></span>
wire. One dropped this,” said the sentry as
he held up an ugly looking <i lang="es">machette</i>.</p>

<p>“That’s mighty bad news,” said Mr. Ryder,
“for it looks to me as if the rebels are planning
an attack. But we’ll fix these wire cutters
to-morrow night. In the meantime you fellows
keep awake and on the lookout until
dawn.”</p>

<p>But when the news of the shadowy wire
cutters was spread about among the men there
was little need for extra vigilance on the part
of the sentries, for every man in the village
stayed up until daylight discussing the possibilities
of an attack. Indeed, the sun was
just rising as Jack and Mr. Ryder turned in
for some much-needed sleep.</p>

<span class="smaller">IMPROVISED SEARCHLIGHTS</span></h2>

<p>“Velly vell, on’y me no likee losee dlishe
pans, Misler Lyder. Me no velly
much can usee pailes to washee dlishes in sometimes.
Jus’ samee me no likee losee dlishe
pan.”</p>

<p>Tom Why’s voice accompanied by the clatter
of tin pans awoke Jack next day, from a
very sound sleep. The lad at first was
thoroughly mystified, for it was rarely that
good natured Tom ever objected to anything
either he or Mr. Ryder did. It was evident,
however, from the pitch of the Chinaman’s
voice that he was slightly indignant.</p>

<p>“Me can no savvy leason to put holes in him
dlish pan. Him alle samee no glood then,”
continued Tom.</p>

<p>“Well, I want to put wires through the bottom
of the pans and make searchlights out of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_152" id="Page_152">[152]</a></span>
them. What if your old pans are spoiled,
Tom. When the next train comes up from
Mexico City I’ll have a carload for you if you
want them,” said Mr. Ryder.</p>

<p>“Me no wantee clarload. Me wantee tlu
dlishe pans, and me no wantee liars put thlu
him bottom, too.”</p>

<p>“All right, Tom,” laughed the engineer;
“you shall have two of the finest dishpans
south of the Rio Grande if you’ll only let me
have these two.”</p>

<p>“Velly vell, velly vell,” said Tom somewhat
appeased at such an attractive offer.</p>

<p>The conversation had done more than
amuse Jack. It had made him thoroughly
curious, for he could not understand how Mr.
Ryder could make a searchlight out of a tin
dishpan. He lost no time in tumbling out of
bed and dressing, and five minutes after the
engineer had left the house the youth was
ready to follow him. Just as Jack entered the
main room, however, Tom Why came in at the
back door.</p>

<p>“Hello there, Tom, did Mr. Ryder confiscate
your dishpans?” asked the boy.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_153" id="Page_153">[153]</a></span></p>

<p>“No him no dloo lat. Him just takee him
dlish plans. Him get Tlom Why tlu flines
likee clums to Melexeclo,” said Tom with a
grin. Then he added, “Allee samee Jack want
him dlinner now?”</p>

<p>“Dinner?” exclaimed the boy, “why, what
time is it? Well, by George, if it isn’t three
o’clock. I’ve slept nearly ten hours. How
long has Mr. Ryder been up?”</p>

<p>“Him alle samee come from him room an’
slay, ‘Tom, glet my bleckflast!’ Then him
look at him clock him slay, ‘Gleat Clats, him
one o’clock. Tom, glet me my dlinner!’” Tom
tried to imitate the engineer as he quoted Mr.
Ryder’s remarks and the result made Jack
laugh heartily.</p>

<p>In a surprisingly short time the Chinaman
had the table spread and a steaming hot meal
before the young American. But the lad hurried
every mouthful (much to Tom’s displeasure),
for he was eager to reach the plant and
witness the operation of converting tin dishpans
into searchlights. Also, he was curious
to know what had transpired since dawn that
morning.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_154" id="Page_154">[154]</a></span></p>

<p>When Jack reached the little machine shop
on the north side of the power plant he found
Mr. Ryder in the center of a pile of wire,
pieces of iron pipe, electric light bulbs and all
sorts of odds and ends. The engineer was
busily engaged with one of Tom’s precious tin
dishpans.</p>

<p>“Oh! there you are, I thought you were due
to sleep all day,” said the engineer banteringly
as Jack arrived. “You are just in time to witness
an attempt to build a genuine spotlight
out of the cook’s most cherished possession.”</p>

<p>“I heard all about it when you were trying
to persuade Tom to be generous with his pans.
What do you mean to do anyway?” said Jack.</p>

<p>“Why, I intend to spring a little surprise on
our wire-cutting friends this evening if they
should happen around, which I expect they will.
I’m going to put a cluster of electric bulbs in
each of these tin dishpans, and put them up on
iron rods in position so that they will sweep
the line of barbed-wire defense. I’m going
to keep them dark until the sentries see the
‘shadows’ that visited us last night, then I’m
going to switch them on and have a firing<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_155" id="Page_155">[155]</a></span>
party ready. Oh! the wire cutters will receive
an ideal reception, I’ll warrant. You see,
fairly bright tin shaped in this manner will
magnify the light beam from three to five
times and that will throw a spotlight as far as
necessary. Tin is an excellent reflector for all
ordinary purposes. With the ten thirty-two
candlepower lamps which I intend to use in
each cluster, I will get a beam of light
1600 candlepower intensity. Of course that
amounts to very little when compared with the
huge thirty-inch searchlight of ours that magnified
a light several hundred times.</p>

<p>“These searchlights will be operated by remote
control; that is, a wire will be run from
the lights to the roof of the power station
where Phil will be on duty as usual. The moment
he gets a signal from the sentries he will
throw on a switch which will connect with
both wires and the line of fence will be lighted
from either direction at once. The firing
squad will be just beyond the lower trenches
and behind the lights, so that they will not be
blinded by the sudden glare. The bandits on
the other hand will be surprised and made temporarily<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_156" id="Page_156">[156]</a></span>
blind by the sudden flash of light and
before they get away the riflemen will discourage
any idea of future wire cutting parties.”</p>

<p>“It sounds like a first-rate scheme,” said
Jack appreciatively. Then suddenly remembering
the prisoner of the night before he
queried: “How is our friend, the rurale?
Have you seen him to-day?”</p>

<p>“Yes, I’ve seen him,” said the engineer as
he paused in his work of fitting a group of
lamp sockets inside the tin pan. “He’s a
mighty meek individual too just now. I guess
his thoughts are on the trial he’s to have to-morrow
morning. The chief witnesses over-slept
this morning or he would probably have
faced court-martial before this. It was a
lucky thing for him that we did oversleep too,
for it gives him a few hours longer to live at
any rate.”</p>

<p>“What does he have to say for himself?”
asked the lad.</p>

<p>“Well, in the first place, he’s the man whom
Señor Yuai described. He did live in the Indian
village over the mountain, and he did<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_157" id="Page_157">[157]</a></span>
cut his foot by stepping on a <i lang="es">machette</i>. His
name is Alfonso Perro. I asked him why he
was sneaking about the place last night and
he said that he had made arrangements with
the peon who keeps the cottage for the lineman
to get some <i lang="es">pulque</i> for the troopers. <i lang="es">Pulque</i>
is the Mexican drink, you know. It is
made from the sap of the century plant or
<i lang="es">maquay</i> plant and when properly prepared is a
very fiery and highly intoxicating drink.
Don’t ever touch it, my boy, for it has ruined
the chance of more than one American who
acquired a taste for it. We do not allow it
to be brought into Necaxa at all, but the rurale
says that every time the linemen’s peon goes
to the village he smuggles in several jugs of the
stuff. Some was smuggled in yesterday and
the rurale said he was on his way to get it and
bring it back to the barracks when you captured
him. Of course I have had the peon
arrested also. He too is in the guardhouse,
but he swears that he has never smuggled <i lang="es">pulque</i>
into Necaxa.</p>

<p>“I accused Perro of having tampered with
the machinery in the plant from time to time<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_158" id="Page_158">[158]</a></span>
and also of stealing my plans, and I must say
he is a very good actor, for he feigned surprise
wonderfully well. But when I told him
how we set a trap for him and discovered that
he had a scar on his foot he looked even more
surprised, and that surprise was genuine. I
think Captain Alvarez, of the rurales, is decidedly
angry over the whole affair and he is
determined to have the prisoner face a firing
squad as soon as possible.”</p>

<p>“Well, I can’t help feeling a little sorry for
the man,” said Jack, who felt rather unhappy
when he realized how much he had helped in
sending the man to his end.</p>

<p>“I feel sorry myself,” added Mr. Ryder,
“and if he would only tell the truth about the
plans and give me some idea where they are
I’d do my utmost to save his life. However,
the best that I could do would be of little avail,
I’m afraid, for Captain Alvarez takes charge
of all prisoners and the man’s fate is entirely
in his hands.”</p>

<p>The two searchlights were completed late
that afternoon, but Mr. Ryder did not make<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_159" id="Page_159">[159]</a></span>
an attempt to erect them until after dark, for
as he explained to Jack, “Those bandits may
have lookouts stationed on the mountains, and
to have them see our new lights would knock
the little surprise party into a cocked hat.”</p>

<p>It required but a very little time to put the
lamps in place, for the engineer had fastened
each tin pan to a section of iron pipe and this
was easily strapped to a tree at either end of
the clearing in front of the plant. The sentries
were carefully coached that night before
they were sent to their post, and most of the
men in the village as well as the extra soldiers
and rurales, gathered in the trenches to watch
for developments.</p>

<p>But hours of waiting under such strained
conditions was far from comfortable and after
a while the men grew restive. In twos and
threes they began to leave for their cottages,
quite disappointed that nothing spectacular
had happened. Jack, who was in the first
trench, began to grow tired of the suspense
too. Indeed, he was just on the point of going
back to the cottage himself, when suddenly<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_160" id="Page_160">[160]</a></span>
a rifle shot rang out at one end of the
clearing. This was followed by another further
up the line of fence and instantly Phil
Underwood, on the roof, jammed home the
switch.</p>

<p>The flood of light that swept along the barricade
revealed almost a score of bandits, with
<i lang="es">machettes</i> and big wire nippers. Some were
discovered in the very act of snipping strands
of wire while others, thoroughly frightened,
were turning to flee, but they had scarcely
moved two steps before the roar of a dozen
rifles burst forth.</p>

<p>Jack saw two men toss up their hands and
pitch forward in the grass. Another staggered
a few steps, then he too fell in a limp
heap. Other shots rang out, but the rebels
got beyond the range of the improvised searchlights
and were lost in the dark before any
others were brought down.</p>

<p>It all transpired so quickly that Jack could
hardly believe his eyes. He felt as if he had
been looking at a motion picture of something
that had taken place in a far-off land. But he<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_161" id="Page_161">[161]</a></span>
realized the horror of it all when several soldiers
crawled under the barbed wire fence and
picked up the three lifeless forms. Indeed,
he was forced to turn away, for the whole
scene became very repulsive to him. The idea
of trapping human beings like rats and slaughtering
them, was hideous. But the other men
laughed and joked over the occurrence exactly
as if they had but recently witnessed a performance
at a theater.</p>

<h2 id="CHAPTER_XVI">CHAPTER XVI<br />
<span class="smaller">A WARNING</span></h2>

<p>“Hi there, Jack, is that you?” called Mr.
Ryder as the lad entered the cottage.</p>

<p>“Yes, but what on earth are you doing here
with all the rumpus down at the plant?”</p>

<p>“Oh, I’ve been here for the last hour or
more. To tell you the truth, my boy, I did not
have the heart to remain and see the outcome.
I knew the trap would work; in fact, I was
afraid it would work too well. How many
men did they kill, Jack?” There was a note
of anxiety in the engineer’s voice as he asked
the question.</p>

<p>“Three,” replied the boy.</p>

<p>“Well, thank heavens it wasn’t more,” said
Mr. Ryder somewhat relieved. “The riflemen
would have had no compunction if the
number had been thirty-three, but I have. It
seems wicked and inhuman to sacrifice three<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_163" id="Page_163">[163]</a></span>
lives in order to teach the beggars a lesson.
It makes me very unhappy.”</p>

<p>Jack was glad to find that Mr. Ryder took
this attitude in the matter. If the truth were
known he had secretly felt a little bitter toward
the engineer for concocting such a diabolical
trap. But when he saw how unhappy it had
made the man his bitterness turned to sympathy.</p>

<p>“It does seem mighty hard to kill three men
in order to teach the rest of them a lesson, but
I suppose it was absolutely necessary for our
own safety,” said the youth in an effort to relieve
the engineer’s feelings.</p>

<p>“You are quite right, my lad. It is hard,
but it had to be done. Sometimes, you know,
the lesson is almost as disagreeable to the
teacher as it is to the pupil. I hope to goodness
we’ll have no more of this slaughter, but
the way the rebels are acting I am very much
afraid that we will be in for a real battle before
the trouble is settled. I sincerely hope
I’m wrong.”</p>

<p>The engineer was sitting at the table in the
center of the room, a mass of blueprints, drawings<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_164" id="Page_164">[164]</a></span>
and typewritten data spread out in front
of him. His shirt was open at the throat, for
the evening was very warm and his revolver
and cartridge belt had been removed and tossed
carelessly on the table before him.</p>

<p>“What are all the plans?” queried Jack as he
sat down opposite the engineer.</p>

<p>“These are the original sketches and preliminary
drawings from which I worked out
my lightning arrester,” replied Mr. Ryder.
“It begins to look as if the stolen papers
weren’t going to turn up. Our rurale with
the scarred foot denies all knowledge of their
whereabouts, which means that he will never
tell where they are, even if he does happen to
know, for a Mexican can be mighty stubborn
when he feels disposed that way. Under the
circumstances, I fancy I’ll have to dig a new set
of blueprints out of these old plans.</p>

<p>“And that isn’t going to be the easiest work
in the world, let me tell you. I have paid very
little attention to the preliminary papers since
I worked out the final plans and the consequence
is many of the more important sketches
and formulas have disappeared. I am mighty<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_165" id="Page_165">[165]</a></span>
sorry that I did not make duplicate drawings
before I sent the plans to Drueryville. The
worst feature of the whole thing is the fact
that I have not yet applied for patent rights
either in this country or the United States.
I could not take this step until I had secured
Dr. Moorland’s formula, you know, because
that was one of the fundamental features of
the new appliance. In that case whoever has
the plans can very easily apply for patents in
his own name and then all my work will have
been for nothing. Indeed, if I wanted to use
my own invention after that I would probably
be forced to pay a royalty to some one else.
That would be a fine how-de-do, wouldn’t
it?”</p>

<p>Though the boy could be of very little assistance
to the engineer, just then, he remained at
the table. Somehow, plans and blueprints had
a certain fascination for Jack, who hoped to become
an engineer some day. He spread one
of the more simple charts before him and tried
to work out the details for himself. How long
he had been absorbed in this task he did not
know, but suddenly, just outside the cottage,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_166" id="Page_166">[166]</a></span>
sounded a patter of naked feet, then some one
sprang upon the porch in front of the door,
shouting as he did so:</p>

<p>“<i lang="es">Los Zapatistas! Los Zapatistas! Viene
Ellos!</i>”</p>

<p>“The rebels, they are coming! What can
he mean!” shouted Mr. Ryder as he leaped
from his chair and reached for his revolver.
The next instant the door was pushed violently
open and an Indian exhausted and with
blood dripping from an ugly wound in his
shoulder, plunged into the room.</p>

<p>“It is Miguel the Indian runner, and he’s
wounded,” exclaimed Jack, immediately recognizing
the red man as the one whose dog he
had saved from the alligator several weeks before.</p>

<p>Clutching the end of the table for support,
the native began to talk very rapidly, and as
the engineer listened, his face took on a
startled and somewhat puzzled look.</p>

<p>“He says that he has run ten miles to warn
us that José Cerro and his band are planning
to attack us to-night!” explained Mr. Ryder
when the native finally ceased talking. “He<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_167" id="Page_167">[167]</a></span>
says that they are on the way now and that
we must hurry and prepare to meet their attack
or we will be overwhelmed!”</p>

<p>“How does he know this?” demanded Jack,
thoroughly excited.</p>

<p>“He carried mail to Los Angeles to-night,”
said Mr. Ryder, “and while he was lingering
in the village a native told him that the famous
bandit José Cerro was there. The native
pointed out the very house where José
Cerro was drinking <i lang="es">pulque</i> with some of his
lieutenants. He became curious to see a man
of such a villainous reputation and crept close
to the shack and peered into the window. He
not only saw the villain but he heard most of
their conversation. He was startled, for he
realized that he was overhearing the plans for
an attack on the power plant. He heard José
Cerro say, ‘The fence wires are all cut by now
and the big searchlight crippled. Everything
is ready for the attack. Our men need only to
rush in, seize Señor Ryder and carry him off.
Then I will collect three thousand pesos from
our benefactor before we start to join Zapata
and capture the railroad. Then if we play our<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_168" id="Page_168">[168]</a></span>
part right we can hold this great electrical
engineer for a ransom from his friends in
America perhaps. If we can’t do that we can
kill him at least, though I’d much prefer to
hold him and collect gringo gold for his release.
How say you, men?’ At this there
were many cheers.</p>

<p>“Miguel became less cautious for he wanted
to hear more. The result was that José Cerro
saw him through the window and fired his
revolver at him. The bullet hit him in the
shoulder. The town was in an uproar immediately
but the runner did not wait. As fast as
he could he ran toward the power plant, glad,
he says, of an opportunity to be of service to
the gringo who saved his dog from the alligators.”</p>

<p>The Indian had stood by the table during
Mr. Ryder’s recital, his face distorted with
the pain of the wound in his shoulder, and as
the lad looked at him he realized just how
much hardship the red man had withstood to
repay a debt of kindness.</p>

<p>“We must prepare to meet the attack immediately,”
said Jack calmly, “but before I move<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_169" id="Page_169">[169]</a></span>
a step I am going to bind up this poor fellow’s
wound and see that he is comfortable.”</p>

<p>“Fine! Take care of him and I’ll go and
spread the alarm. Hurry down to the
trenches when you’re through,” said Mr.
Ryder as he seized a rifle and rushed out the
door.</p>

<p>Although Jack could not talk to the Indian,
he soon made the red man understand by motions
that he wanted to take care of the bullet
wound. The native smiled gratefully at this
and sat down in Mr. Ryder’s chair while the
young American hastened out to Tom Why’s
cook house. The lad routed the worthy
Chinaman out of bed and bade him heat some
water immediately. In the meantime, he
found some clean linen with which to make
bandages.</p>

<p>Tom Why was a willing assistant and in
short order all blood stains had been wiped
from the runner’s chest and arm and the
wound bathed. Then Jack bound a bandage
tightly about the injured shoulder and after
preparing a cup of steaming hot coffee, showed<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_170" id="Page_170">[170]</a></span>
the native to one of the bedrooms and insisted
that he lay down and rest for a while. During
all this, the tawny yellow hound which had
followed the Indian into the cottage, kept close
to his master’s side. The animal seemed to
appreciate everything that Jack and Tom did
for the redman, for his tail wagged furiously
all the time. And when the runner lay down
upon Jack’s bed the hound curled himself up
in the doorway as if to keep guard while
Miguel was sleeping.</p>

<p>When the Indian was comfortable, the Vermonter
buckled on his own revolver, and slinging
a heavy cartridge belt over his shoulder
seized one of the rifles in the corner and hurried
out to the trenches.</p>

<p>At the plant every one was in a state of excitement.
The ugly-looking, three-inch fieldpiece
had been unjacketed and made ready for
action. The battery of French machine guns,
those death-dealing instruments that fired more
than four hundred shots a minute, had all been
mounted and manned, and soldiers and workmen
alike all fully armed, waited crouching in
the trenches. The two improvised searchlights<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_171" id="Page_171">[171]</a></span>
were still burning and by their light the
whole scene looked weird and uncanny.</p>

<p>Mr. Ryder was as active as the rest, directing
the position of the defenders and arranging
other details. But in the midst of it all he
found time to call Jack aside and hold a brief
conversation with him.</p>

<p>“That Indian’s story has me thoroughly puzzled.
If all he says is true, and I have no reason
to believe otherwise, some one is certainly
plotting for my downfall. Whom do you suppose
José Cerro’s ‘benefactor’ is anyway?
This is the most mysterious situation I have
ever been mixed up with in my life. It certainly
has me guessing. I wonder if—Look!
Look! See that flash over there! On the
mountain! Listen! Hear the roar! It’s the
rebels! They’ve lugged their old fieldpiece up
there again. They are trying to drop shells
down here! Ho, boys! Bill! Joe! Did you
see that flash! Throw a shell or two up there
the next time they fire!” The last was addressed
to the men in charge of the three-inch
gun.</p>

<p>Again came the flash, then the far-off roar<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_172" id="Page_172">[172]</a></span>
and Jack heard the shell go humming high in
the air above the plant and burst against the
mountain across the river. But this time the
gun on the mountain was answered by the one
at the plant. The battery belched forth a
cloud of fire and smoke and a moment later
Jack saw a flash of fire in the woods across
the valley where the shell exploded. The fieldpiece
at the plant was of the quick-firing
variety and four shots were hurled up on to the
mountain before another one was sent toward
the station.</p>

<p>Twice shells burst within the inclosure
about the plant, one carrying away a section
of the rurales’ barracks hall and setting fire to
the rest of it. The flames added to the excitement
of the occasion but were quickly extinguished
by two men with a hose, held in readiness
for that very kind of emergency. Until
just before daylight, the firing kept up, then
the gun on the mountain became strangely silent
and the men at Necaxa concluded that
their shells had put it into disuse forever.
But when the first golden streak of morning
showed above the mountain tops, and the valley<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_173" id="Page_173">[173]</a></span>
became light enough for the men to see any
distance, a new terror took the place of the
gun on the mountain. From here and there
in the underbrush across the valley bottom
came tiny jets of smoke, and Jack for the first
time in his life heard the ominous hum of
bullets fired with deadly earnestness. José
Cerro’s sharpshooters seemed everywhere and
the flying pellets of lead and steel kicked up
the dust in all directions. For a long time the
rifles in the trenches were silent, for the men
could locate no one to fire at. The fieldpiece,
however, kept shelling the forest but with little
effect, for the gunners could not see the
enemy.</p>

<p>Then suddenly two natives showed themselves
on the edge of the wood. Instantly, a
volley rang out from the defenders and the
French machine guns began to rattle viciously.
The battle was on!</p>

<hr />

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_174" id="Page_174">[174]</a></span></p>

<h2 id="CHAPTER_XVII">CHAPTER XVII<br />
<span class="smaller">“WHO WILL BE FOOD FOR THE VULTURES!”</span></h2>

<p>Of the two men, one advanced. The other
lay writhing in pain on the ground, but
his place was taken by twenty more, forty
more, eighty more, a hundred, two hundred.
They emerged from every bush, from behind
trees, they arose from the long grass, they
appeared as if by magic. On they came, yelling,
screaming; swarthy faces distorted, the
lust of battle in their eyes.</p>

<p>“Here they come, boys! Steady! Keep
cool and fight, <em>fight</em>, <em class="smcap">fight</em>!” screamed Mr.
Ryder to the men in the trenches.</p>

<p>His instructions were answered by a mighty
cheer; a war-cry that sent a thrill down Jack
Straw’s back.</p>

<p>All thoughts of danger, all thoughts of
everything but the fight, were driven from the
lad’s brain by that cheer. In his hands he<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_175" id="Page_175">[175]</a></span>
gripped a rifle. About his shoulders were
two hundred rounds of ammunition. With
these he must fight, <em>fight</em>, <em class="smcap">fight</em>!</p>

<p>He was surprised to find how calm and collected
he felt as he crouched there in the first
trench, shoulder to shoulder with a rurale on
one side and Harvey Carroll on the other.
Over his head whistled a thousand screaming
messengers of death. They plunged into the
earthy embankment in front of him and threw
dirt and pebbles into his eyes and mouth.
They whistled past his cheeks and thumped
against the wall of the power station behind
him. Yet for all he was calm, insanely calm,
it seemed to him.</p>

<p>Carefully and methodically he slipped a shell
from his cartridge belt and held it between his
teeth while he threw open the breech block of
his rifle. Without any apparent haste he
slipped the brass thing home, closed the breech
and put the piece to his shoulder. Then with
the utmost deliberation he selected one of those
ugly distorted faces for his target and taking
careful aim pulled the trigger.</p>

<p>Thus did the boy load and fire, load and fire,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_176" id="Page_176">[176]</a></span>
a dozen times while the screaming mob came
on. All along the double line of trenches,
workmen and soldiers were doing the same as
he. And behind him the battery of French
machine guns, two on the roof and the others
against the wall of the power station, spat
vehemently four hundred times a minute.
Yet with all this stubborn defense the motley
mob advanced. They rushed, shrieking and
screaming, across the valley bottom toward the
barbed-wire barricade, pausing only to reload
and fire. They came on, on, on, sombreros
and jackets flapping, red lips parted and white
teeth showing like a pack of bloodthirsty
wolves. Two men reached the barbed-wire
fence, one began to climb but he stopped at the
second strand and his bullet-riddled body hung
on the fence for the rest of the battle. The
other hacked away with a <i lang="es">machette</i>, trying
hard to sever the wires. Jack was surprised to
see how long he remained exposed to the
grueling fire before he fell.</p>

<p>Others reached the fence; one man clutched
the top strand and vaulted clear, but he did not
stand on his feet when he landed. Another<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_177" id="Page_177">[177]</a></span>
climbed a post only to pitch backward, bowling
over two men directly behind him. But they
came so thick and fast after that, that Jack
could only see them as a mass. They pressed
against the barrier like cattle; they raged, they
cursed, they screamed, while the bullets from
the machine guns mowed them down like rye
before a scythe. But the press was too great!
The fence came down with a crash and the
way to the plant was cleared for them!</p>

<p>A groan arose from the trenches when the
men saw this, for the Necaxa force was outnumbered
five to one in spite of the havoc of
the machine guns. Jack’s spirit sank with the
rest, for he realized that the end was near unless
they could stop the rush of that bloodthirsty
mob. But suddenly he heard a voice
above the roar of battle and looking in the direction
from whence it came, he saw Mr. Ryder
standing exposed on the embankment of the
first trench.</p>

<p>“Boys, boys!” he shouted; “look overhead!
The vultures! Shall they feed on us or the
greasers to-night?” Jack looked aloft, there
in the blue heavens were two huge birds circling
slowly around over the battle field. It
was dramatic! It was hideous! Others
looked, too, and the grim specter had its effect.</p>

<p>“The greasers! the greasers! let them be
food for the vultures! Make them carrion,
fellows!” was the cry that went up from the
trenches, and some men in their anger stood
bolt upright to load and fire. The rain of
bullets that swept down the grassy slope was
annihilating. The oncoming mob stopped!
The rebels’ dogged rush was checked! For
five minutes they tried to hold their ground
against the withering fire. Then suddenly
they broke and ran for cover.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 700px;" id="illus3">
<img src="images/illus3.jpg" width="700" height="475" alt="" />
<p class="caption">“They pressed against the barrier like cattle”</p>
</div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_178" id="Page_178">[178]</a></span></p>

<p>At this a shout of triumph went up from the
trenches. The men all stood upright then and
pumped bullets after the scattered force of
José Cerro. Jack discarded his rifle entirely
and drawing his revolver leapt to the top of
the breastworks and fired, round after round
at the tattered brigade that was hurrying
across the valley, until the last of the Mexicans
was lost in the forest. Then he paused and
as he wiped the perspiration from his brow, he
remarked to no one in particular:</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_179" id="Page_179">[179]</a></span></p>

<p>“By crackey, for excitement this beats all.”</p>

<p>Harvey Carroll overheard him and smiled.
“So it appeals to you, eh?” he queried.</p>

<p>“Appeals to me? No, not exactly, but
nevertheless it’s exciting! How long did it
last? About fifteen minutes, I guess.”</p>

<p>But Jack was disillusioned on this point
when he looked at his watch. He could hardly
believe it but he had been in the midst of death
for two hours and had come through it all
without a single scratch. This was not true of
others, however. From here and there in the
trenches came groans of anguish, telling plainly
that more than one of the murderous soft-nosed
Mexican bullets had found its mark.
Jack saw many motionless forms too, and he
knew that the power plant would be short
handed for a while.</p>

<p>The lad did not have long to view the situation,
however, for soon he heard the voice of
the engineer giving commands in English and
Spanish. These were to the effect that every
man should get busy and repair the broken-down
barricade before the rebels rallied and
began another assault. Rifles were discarded<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_180" id="Page_180">[180]</a></span>
immediately and axes and shovels substituted.
With these, soldiers and workmen alike began
to reset the broken-down posts and restring
the wires. Jack and Mr. Ryder did their part.
They worked side by side with the rest, in
spite of the fact that they had been longer
than twenty-four hours without sleep.</p>

<p>Once Jack paused in his work and standing
erect, viewed the valley. Dead men lay
everywhere. They were piled thick along the
line of fence and scattered broadcast from the
bottom of the slope to the edge of the wood,
and though the bodies were not yet cold the
vultures were feeding. The scavengers of
Mexico were already at work clearing the battle
field.</p>

<p>As soon as the fence was repaired and reinforced
with hundreds of feet of extra barbed
wire which the workmen brought from the
storehouse, Mr. Ryder appointed a hospital
squad and a burial squad from amongst the
infantry men. They were detailed to go
across the valley gathering up the dead and
the wounded. When this was well under way
the engineer returned to the plant, to look after<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_181" id="Page_181">[181]</a></span>
the hospital work there. Lyman, Carroll and
several other Americans who were not needed
inside the plant at that time, had gathered up
the injured and taken them inside a big well-lighted
toolhouse.</p>

<p>Mr. Ryder glanced about the room; he
studied the faces of the wounded and scrutinized
the attendants closely. Finally, he
turned to Jack and said:</p>

<p>“Say, son, have you seen my assistant?
Nedham, I mean. I haven’t seen him since
last night. I was looking for him in the
trenches, but couldn’t find him. Thought
maybe he was wounded early and brought
here.”</p>

<p>Jack could not recall having seen Nedham.
So Mr. Ryder called Lyman.</p>

<p>“Hi, Lyman, come here.”</p>

<p>Lyman made his way between the prostrated
forms to his chief’s side.</p>

<p>“Have you seen Nedham, lately?” queried
the engineer.</p>

<p>“Why—er—ah, why I think the last glimpse
I caught of him was when the three-inch fieldpiece
opened up. He came through the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_182" id="Page_182">[182]</a></span>
operating room. Said he was on his way to
the roof to look after some machine guns up
there. Haven’t seen him since.”</p>

<p>“Well,” said Mr. Ryder, “that’s a peculiar
place for my assistant when I need him alongside
of me all the time. If you see him again
tell him I want him. He’ll find me here with
the wounded.”</p>

<p>Jack was surprised to find out how many
had been injured in the battle. There were
more than a score of workmen and soldiers
stretched out on the toolhouse floor, and the
few Americans available had all they could do
to care for the wants of the wounded. Jack
noted that one of the busiest of the attendants
was the Indian runner whom he had left in
his room before the battle started. The red
man was going about among the wounded with
a gourd of water in his right hand. His left
was bandaged tightly across his breast and
entirely useless because of José Cerro’s bullet.
Jack learned later on that the messenger had
entered the trenches at the opening of the battle
and all through the conflict had handled a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_183" id="Page_183">[183]</a></span>
huge six shooter which he had found in Mr.
Ryder’s cottage.</p>

<p>The youth and the engineer turned to with
the rest and tried to make things more comfortable
for the sufferers. They had not been
at work long, however, before Arthur Strong,
the tall, light-haired day operator, came rushing
in. The moment he saw Mr. Ryder he
began to shout:</p>

<p>“The lines are down! The lines are down!
Mexico City’s service is cut off.”</p>

<hr />

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_184" id="Page_184">[184]</a></span></p>

<h2 id="CHAPTER_XVIII">CHAPTER XVIII<br />
<span class="smaller">THE WIRES ARE DOWN</span></h2>

<p>The news was staggering! Mr. Ryder
stood blinking at the man for fully a
minute before he could comprehend the situation.
Then as he realized that his one desire,
to keep the current flowing uninterruptedly
into Mexico City, had been thwarted, his face
grew very white and tense, but instantly this
expression changed to one of determination.</p>

<p>“We’ll put these lines back again in the face
of every obstacle,” he thundered. Then,
turning, he addressed the men in the room.</p>

<p>“Boys, the lines are down! For the first
time since I’ve been in charge of Necaxa,
Mexico City is without juice! I’m going to
open the service again! Who is going to help
me!”</p>

<p>“I am!” came the chorus and every man who
could stand crowded about the engineer and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_185" id="Page_185">[185]</a></span>
pleaded to be taken along. Even some of the
wounded men raised themselves on their
elbows and begged to be permitted to help in
the crisis.</p>

<p>Quietly and methodically Mr. Ryder went
about picking out his assistants. Two burly
Mexican linemen were the first selected, then
Harvey Carroll of the maintenance department
under whose jurisdiction came all the
repair work along the transmission line, and
last of all a swarthy rurale, known among the
men as the best rider and best marksman of
all the Necaxa troop.</p>

<p>“You five will be enough. Carroll, you and
the linemen get your repair kits and have the
<i lang="es">mozos</i> saddle five horses. We’re to start immediately.”
Then as the men were turning to
go, the engineer called them together again.</p>

<p>“Perhaps I should warn you boys of the
dangers that face us. I have an idea that this
breaking down of the transmission lines is
nothing more or less than a trap. Where we
find the trouble we will also find a swarm of
rebels ambushed. They may shoot us from
the poles just as they would shoot so many<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_186" id="Page_186">[186]</a></span>
pheasants. In fact, the more I think of it the
more confident I am that they have pulled the
wires down for the very purpose of luring
some of us out into the mountains so that they
can square accounts. Considering the situation
in that light, do you all feel just as enthusiastic
about going?”</p>

<p>“You bet we do,” came the hearty response
and the five men hurried out to get their equipment
together.</p>

<p>“Fine,” said Mr. Ryder, then turning and
addressing the rest of the men in the toolhouse
he said:</p>

<p>“It will be up to you fellows to guard the
place from an attack until we return. I know
your number is small now and some of our
best fighters are out of commission, but just
the same you must hold the place against any
further assault. I don’t expect you’ll have
much trouble after the way we treated José
Cerro and his rebels this morning, but nevertheless
you can’t afford to have your eyes
closed. Clear up the place and get everything
shipshape and ready for instant action.</p>

<p>“And as for you,” he continued, turning to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_187" id="Page_187">[187]</a></span>
Jack Straw, “you’ve acquitted yourself well
to-day and I must compliment you. Now, to
top off all this, I want you to keep your eyes
on the clock. It is exactly eleven o’clock. If
we are not back or you do not get word from
us by three this afternoon, arrange with Captain
Alvarez, of the rurales, to have the whole
squad ride the transmission line in search of
us. They may get there in time to find our
dead bodies, but anyway we can feel certain of
a decent burial, can’t we, my boy?”</p>

<p>“You’re right you can, but I certainly hope
that we’ll be able to locate you before burial
is necessary, if we have to look for you at
all,” replied Jack.</p>

<p>A few moments later the four other members
of the repair squad rode up to the door
of the improvised hospital, leading Mr.
Ryder’s mount. The engineer shook hands
with all his friends and bade them good-by
while his assistants did likewise. Then when
all were mounted and ready, word was given
and the five horses went racing across the enclosure,
through the gate and on to the trail
that followed the line of transmission cables.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_188" id="Page_188">[188]</a></span>
For half an hour they pushed ahead at a
steady canter, keeping a careful watch on the
shrubbery and underbrush for signs of the
enemy. They saw any number of dead rebels.
All along the trail were bodies of men who
had been wounded in the recent battle and
who had followed their companions until they
dropped from sheer exhaustion.</p>

<p>About four miles from Necaxa they located
the break. The four large cables were completely
down, but fortunately the parallel telephone
wire was still in service. At first Mr.
Ryder was at loss to know just how the peons
had done the work until he examined the cable
and discovered bullet marks.</p>

<p>“I have it,” he exclaimed suddenly; “the
greasers have pumped shot into the cables and
insulators until the lines simply couldn’t stay
up. I guess the telephone wire was too small
for them to hit. I’m mighty glad they are
such poor shots. They have done very little
damage for the cables are not cut to amount to
anything. All that is necessary is some new
porcelain insulators on the poles and a little
patchwork on the lines and we will be able to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_189" id="Page_189">[189]</a></span>
give Huerta his service in an hour. Come,
boys, up the poles there and get the insulators
in place. Cut in on the ’phone line and tell
the station we’ll have the work done in an
hour.”</p>

<p>The men became active immediately, even
the rurale taking a hand in the work. From
the four repair kits enough insulators were
secured to equip the pole. The two linemen
were sent aloft to install these while Mr.
Ryder, Carroll and the rurale stayed on the
ground to repair the lines. They were all so
thoroughly busy and so absorbed in their work
that none of them heard the soft patter of
naked feet on the trail and in the underbrush
about the pole. Indeed, they were surprised
almost to the point of speechlessness when a
wicked-faced little Mexican, revolver in hand,
stepped into full view before them and requested
them in Spanish to hold up their
hands.</p>

<p>Mr. Ryder and the rurale jumped up simultaneously
and reached for their guns but the
ugly-looking Mexican merely smiled as he
turned his revolver to cover them completely.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_190" id="Page_190">[190]</a></span></p>

<p>“Ah, Señor Ryder, I would not try to shoot
if I were you, the woods are full of rifles,” he
said very politely in Spanish. And it was
true. Mr. Ryder could see a peon behind
every bush and tree.</p>

<p>“It is José Cerro,” hissed the rurale as he
put his hands above his head.</p>

<p>“Yes, it is I, José Cerro,” answered the
Mexican calmly. Then turning to the
engineer he said, “I hoped to get some of you
in this trap, but I never expected to have the
good fortune of capturing Señor Ryder, I am
sure. I am indeed honored to have you as my
prisoner. I am also pleased for other reasons,
for your capture means three thousand
pesos to me and perhaps more, who knows.”</p>

<p>“Three thousand pesos! Who will give you
that amount?” demanded the engineer.</p>

<p>“Ah, señor, would it be loyal of me to reveal
the name of my benefactor, especially
when he does not want his identity known?”
asked Zapata’s lieutenant suavely. Then he
answered the question himself by saying,
“No, no, that would not be kind. I cannot
tell you, Señor Ryder, but I can tell you that<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_191" id="Page_191">[191]</a></span>
you must come with me. You must hurry too,
before your rurales hear of this trap. For
my force is far too small as it is, thanks to the
excellent fighting of you gringoes. Ho! men!
come, take these monkeys from their perch on
the pole. We must away with our prisoners.
Come!”</p>

<p>A horde of battle-scarred peons appeared
immediately, and with threatening speech and
gestures managed to persuade the two Mexican
linemen to climb down from the pole. Each
of the five prisoners was commanded to
mount his horse, then according to José
Cerro’s instructions, peons bound their feet together
under the horses’ stomachs and tied
their hands behind their backs. This done the
leader gave a few brief commands and the
band started to move, striking off at right
angle to the trail that followed the transmission
line. They seemed to be following an invisible
path through the thicket that led into
a narrow ravine between the mountains in the
direction of the broad valley where Los Angeles
was located.</p>

<p>But they had hardly left the tiny clearing<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_192" id="Page_192">[192]</a></span>
about the pole when the figure of an Indian
and a tawny hound crept out of the bushes.
The redman was clad only in canvas trousers
that were rolled up to his knees, and his left
arm and shoulder was swathed in bandages.
A moment he paused while his black eyes
searched the ground and the surrounding
shrubbery. Suddenly he caught sight of the
narrow trail left by the cavalcade.</p>

<p>“Ugh,” he grunted, “they have gone toward
the sunrise. They have no horses. We shall
easily catch José Cerro.” He paused a moment
longer to examine the trail, then, standing
erect, he mused:</p>

<p>“I am right. Only so many horses as I
have fingers, no more. Those are Señor
Ryder’s.”</p>

<p>And he disappeared as silently as he came.</p>

<h2 id="CHAPTER_XIX">CHAPTER XIX<br />
<span class="smaller">TO THE RESCUE!</span></h2>

<p>It was some time before Jack and the rest
of the Americans were able to make the
wounded comfortable in the makeshift hospital.
When the task was accomplished, however,
Phil Underwood and Lance Carpenter
were put in permanent charge of the toolhouse.
Their first action was to bar everyone
else from entering the building and disturbing
their patients.</p>

<p>Since nothing remained for Jack to do but
obey these orders, the lad soon left the place
and sought employment with the men who
were engaged in eliminating the evidences of
the recent battle from the vicinity of the
power house. In the meantime, however, he
kept careful track of the time and constant
watch for some message from Mr. Ryder and
the repair crew.</p>

<p>As a result of the industriousness of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_194" id="Page_194">[194]</a></span>
regulars, the dead and wounded were fast being
removed from the valley. Those who
still showed signs of life were carried to the
toolhouse to be cared for by Phil and Lance.
The dead men were carried into the forest to
the west. This puzzled Jack for he could not
understand why graves were not dug in the
open. Indeed, he became so curious about the
whole thing that he finally asked Lyman what
the regulars did with the bodies.</p>

<p>“In Mexico,” explained Lyman, “they don’t
bother to bury dead men after a battle. They
merely gather them all in one pile, saturate
them with kerosene and touch a match to them.
You see, bodies must be removed quickly in
the Tropics or serious disease will be spread
immediately. The funeral pyre is the quickest
and best method of avoiding this danger.”</p>

<p>“Goodness, but that’s a gruesome way of
caring for the dead. But then, I suppose, it
is best from a sanitary standpoint and it certainly
is far better than leaving the remains for
the vultures.”</p>

<p>“Si, señor, it es best zan ze vultures,” said
some one in broken English, and Jack and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_195" id="Page_195">[195]</a></span>
Lyman turned to find Captain Alvarez, of the
rurales, addressing them. “I hear your remarks
what you say about dead mens and I
agree. Fire es best zan ze vultures. Oh; ze
vultures zay are ah—what you call—ah—higeous,
eh!”</p>

<p>“Indeed they are hideous. They are the
most repulsive creatures I have ever seen,”
said Jack.</p>

<p>“Ah, you are right, Señor Jack, but it is not
of vulture I wish to see you for. It is of my
mans Alfonso Perro, the one wiz ze scar foot
which is in ze guardhouse now. We mus give
him ze court-martial soon and ze execution.
Also his peon assistant must we shoot. Will
you and Señor Ryder be ready for ze court
zis evening?”</p>

<p>“I think so,” replied Jack. “I will be ready
and I think Mr. Ryder will—”</p>

<p>“Who is that,” interrupted Lyman, pointing
across the clearing in the direction of the
trail that followed the transmission line.</p>

<p>Jack beheld a swarthy, long-haired individual
clad only in white trousers running toward
the power plant, a dog loping along at<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_196" id="Page_196">[196]</a></span>
his heels. The man’s stride was long and
regular, like that of an experienced distance
runner, and the lad recognized him immediately
as the Indian messenger.</p>

<p>“Why, it’s the runner. I saw him here at
the plant only an hour ago. I wonder where
he’s been? I’ll warrant he has word about
Mr. Ryder.”</p>

<p>Together Jack and Lyman hurried to greet
the messenger who by this time had crawled
under the barbed-wire fence and was swinging
up the slope. But while he was still some
distance away he began to call in Spanish.</p>

<p>“What does he say?” queried Jack of Lyman,
who had been listening intently to catch
every word.</p>

<p>“Quick, call out the rurales!” replied Lyman;
“he says that the repair crew has been
taken prisoners by José Cerro himself!”</p>

<p>“But how does he know? How did he get
the information?” demanded Jack.</p>

<p>“Don’t know, he must have slipped out and
followed Mr. Ryder and his men. Hurry,
we’ve no time to lose. He will guide us.”</p>

<p>But Captain Alvarez had followed them<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_197" id="Page_197">[197]</a></span>
down the slope and he needed no persuading.
He had understood everything the Indian
said and even while Lyman was urging him to
hurry the officer drew a tiny silver whistle
from his pocket and blew three shrill blasts
upon it. A moment later an orderly appeared
running toward the commander.</p>

<p>Brief instructions were given and the soldier
hurried back toward the plant again.
Five minutes later the clear notes of a bugle
echoed and re-echoed through the valley, calling
the troopers to saddle.</p>

<p>By the time the three arrived at the corral
the rurales were ready. There were other
horsemen, too, eager to go to the rescue of Mr.
Ryder, for the news had been spread throughout
Necaxa and all the Americans who could
be spared and who could find horses or mules
to ride upon had gathered with the troopers.</p>

<p><i lang="es">Mozos</i> found mounts for Jack and Lyman
and the Indian runner, and in less than twenty
minutes after Miguel appeared upon the trail
the troop was galloping out of the enclosure
and along the path that followed the transmission
lines. Captain Alvarez, the Indian, Jack<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_198" id="Page_198">[198]</a></span>
and Lyman were in the lead and the rest of
the band was strung out behind, their position
depending entirely upon the speed of their
horses. And as they galloped toward the
break in the transmission line the wounded Indian
explained how he had left the toolhouse
hospital and followed the repair crew at a distance,
hoping to be of assistance in case of
trouble. But soon he began to find traces of
the presence of rebels along the trail. He
tried to reach Mr. Ryder and warn him of
the ambush, but he said that the woods in the
vicinity of the pole on which the men were
working were so full of José Cerro’s men that
he could not get through their lines without
running the risk of being shot. Quietly he
waited until he could be certain of the direction
José Cerro and his men would lead their
prisoners. Then he returned to Necaxa as
fast as he could run.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 475px;" id="illus4">
<img src="images/illus4.jpg" width="475" height="700" alt="" />
<p class="caption">“The horsemen in green swept down the valley”</p>
</div>

<p>Half an hour after the rurales left the plant
they arrived at the point where the transmission
line was down. Here the Indian dismounted
and looked over the ground carefully.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_199" id="Page_199">[199]</a></span></p>

<p>“They are many peons,” he said laconically
to Captain Alvarez as he remounted and
started toward the trail that led into the ravine.
In single file the horsemen followed
their guide, for nearly an hour before they
reached the end of the rocky pass, from the
mouth of which they could look down into the
broad valley that held Los Angeles. Off in
the distance Jack saw a line of soldiers winding
its way toward the little community.</p>

<p>“There, there, over there! Those are José
Cerro’s men with their prisoners!” exclaimed
Captain Alvarez in Spanish. “Come! At
them, men!”</p>

<p>The call of the bugle trumpeting the charge
sounded through the valley. José Cerro and
his men heard it and began to hurry forward
at double-quick time. But they soon saw that
escape was impossible, for the horsemen rushed
down upon them swiftly. All that remained
for the peons to do was stand and fight.
Hurriedly they formed a circle about their
prisoners and with guns pointing on every side
prepared to repel the rurales.</p>

<p>The horsemen in green swept down from<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_200" id="Page_200">[200]</a></span>
the ravine ’mid the thunder of hoofs and the
shouts of infuriated men! Indian fashion the
squad split, a wing skirting either side of the
valley. On they came firing from their saddles
with carbine or revolver and menacing
José Cerro’s men from every side. But the
little knot of peons were courageous. They
loaded and fired in lightning fashion and the
rattle of their musketry sounded like a battery
of machine guns in action. They were
making a last and desperate stand and they
fought doggedly!</p>

<p>Round and round the little group of men
swept the cavalry, making the circle ever narrower.
Jack rode with the rest of them, lying
close to his horse’s neck and firing his revolver.
But in the heat of it all he never took
his eyes from the prisoners in the center of
the circle of rebels. There were Mr. Ryder
and his assistants exposed to the fire of the
men from the plant. Jack expected to see one
of them topple from his horse at any moment,
pierced by the bullets of their friends.</p>

<p>But gradually the nerve of the fighting
rebels began to go. Three of them left their<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_201" id="Page_201">[201]</a></span>
companions and tried to break through the line
of horsemen. Jack saw a rurale ride one of
them down. The other two were shot before
they had gone a dozen yards. Two more
tried to get through, only to be trampled down
by the flying horsemen. José Cerro and his
men were trapped. There was no way for
them to get beyond the circle of horsemen.
Some threw down their arms and cried for
mercy while others broke and ran; ran as far
as they could go before a bullet brought them
to the ground or a horse trampled them under
foot.</p>

<p>Then in the midst of it all, while Jack was
still keeping a watchful eye on Mr. Ryder, the
lad saw the engineer suddenly jerked down
from his mount, and in his place on the horse’s
back appeared a wicked-looking little Mexican.
The man set spurs to the horse immediately
and tried to ride through the crush of humans
about him. He cursed and shouted for his
men to make way and those who did not move
fast enough he beat over the head with the
butt of his revolver.</p>

<p>“Look! look!” shrieked Jack; “their leader<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_202" id="Page_202">[202]</a></span>
is getting away! José Cerro is escaping!”
Then rolling his spurs across his animal’s
flanks he gave chase. But others saw the
escaping leader and more than one horseman
turned his mount down the valley after the
fleeing rebel.</p>

<p>It was a short race. José Cerro had hardly
time to get his steed down to its pace before
Jack and two rurales reached his side. One
man seized the horse’s bridle and threw the
animal back up on its haunches. With a curse
the Zapatista drew his revolver. But Jack
happened fortunately to be on the right side
of the rebel. His revolver spat fire twice before
the Mexican could raise his arm. José
Cerro shrieked with pain. The revolver
dropped from his helpless fingers and he reeled
in the saddle. The other rurale caught him
as he was falling and steadied him on the prancing
horse.</p>

<p>The fighting had ceased by this time for
most of the peons, seeing their leader in full
flight, had surrendered. The Mexican linemen
and the Americans who were still tied to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_203" id="Page_203">[203]</a></span>
their horses had been liberated immediately
and the rurales were busy forming the remainder
of the rebel band in a double line and
disarming them.</p>

<p>Jack and Mr. Ryder greeted each other
warmly when the former drove up, escorting
the wounded leader.</p>

<p>“By George, boy, I’m mighty glad you got
the rurales out when you did. It began to
look to us as if we were in for a rather disagreeable
time with José Cerro. José, you
know, is a dangerous individual at best, and
any one who is unfortunate enough to become
his prisoner is very liable to suffer.”</p>

<p>“Yes, I am glad I arrived before it was
necessary to superintend your ‘decent burial,’
but the credit is not due me. Miguel, our Indian
runner, once more appeared in the nick
of time. He saw you leaving for the mountains
and all unknown to us he trailed you.
He saw you captured and hurried back to the
plant and spread the news. Where is he
now?”</p>

<p>“There he is yonder on his horse, looking<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_204" id="Page_204">[204]</a></span>
like a bronze statue. I’m going over and
shake hands with him. He’s a brave boy,”
said Mr. Ryder.</p>

<p>To have the great gringo engineer shake
hands with him and compliment him pleased
the Indian runner a great deal in spite of the
fact that he became very self-conscious when
Mr. Ryder told him how brave he really was.</p>

<p>“I’m not brave,” he said in Spanish. “I
merely repay a kindness. Also, I am glad to
see José Cerro captured. If he is not killed
by the rurales I myself will kill him for this.”
The Indian pointed gravely to his wounded
shoulder as he spoke.</p>

<p>But Mr. Ryder did not hear all that the Indian
said for the grounded transmission line
was worrying him. He looked at his watch
then hurried off to where Carroll and several
men from the plant were standing.</p>

<p>“Come, we’ve still time to fix up that transmission
line before nightfall. Get the linemen
together and we’ll start back through the ravine.
The Indian will lead us and if we
hurry we will be able to put things in condition
so that Mexico City can have light to-night.”</p>

<h2 id="CHAPTER_XX">CHAPTER XX<br />
<span class="smaller">“SHOOT! SHOOT!”</span></h2>

<p>It was long after sunrise next morning
when the cavalcade of horsemen and their
prisoners appeared at the station. Though
the wires had been restrung and service
started at nightfall the previous evening, the
rescuers and rescued as well were too tired
even to make the four-mile ride back to the
plant. They had all been without sleep for
practically forty-eight hours and even while
the lines were being repaired many of the
rurales tossed themselves on the ground and
promptly became unconscious. The result
was a night camp along the transmission line
trail with no guard except that maintained
over the prisoners, and this was hardly necessary
for the rebels had been awake as long, if
not longer, than the men from the power
house, and were equally as tired.</p>

<p>Necaxa was not awake either when the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_206" id="Page_206">[206]</a></span>
rurales arrived. Aside from the few regular
soldiers who were doing sentry duty, no one
seemed to be stirring about the little town.
The night men, who had been forced to stay
awake longer than the rest, had already left
the station and crawled into bed thoroughly
weary. But the clatter of hoofs and the
shouts of the soldiers greeting the returning
fighters awakened many of them and attracted
the attention of the men at work in the power
station. Soon the community was alive with
curious soldiers and workmen, all eager to
hear of the adventures of Mr. Ryder and his
repair crew. But when they saw the line of
prisoners and beheld José Cerro, helpless on
a stretcher made of one of the rurale’s
blankets, they cheered lustily, for the capture
of the rebel leader meant that the country was
rid of one of its most vicious bandits.</p>

<p>Arthur Strong, the day operator, was one
of the first to greet the engineer. The moment
he heard the soldiers arrive he left the
control room in charge of his assistant and
hurried downstairs.</p>

<p>“By Jove, we were mighty pleased to get<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_207" id="Page_207">[207]</a></span>
your telephone message last night,” he said to
Mr. Ryder. “We thought that Cerro had
done away with all of you. I am glad to see
you again. You too, Jack, old boy.” Strong
shook hands with his superior as he spoke.
“And, say, perhaps you don’t think we’ve had
one fine time around here since you left yesterday
afternoon,” he continued, to Mr. Ryder.
“Things nearly went to the devil until we
locked that man Nedham up.”</p>

<p>“Nedham,” exclaimed Mr. Ryder; “what’s
he been doing?”</p>

<p>“Doing?” exclaimed Long; “why the man’s
been drunk on <i lang="es">pulque</i>! You know what that
stuff will do with you. I hadn’t seen him since
the battle until last night after the rurales
cleared out. About eight o’clock he came
stumbling into the control room. His eyes
were bulging out and his face was red and
ugly. I was on duty and I had about made
up my mind to stick through the night, since
Lyman had gone with the rescuers. Nedham
came staggering in just when I was busiest.
He said <em>he</em> was going to run the plant for the
night. I could see that he was in no shape to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_208" id="Page_208">[208]</a></span>
run anything nor to issue orders either, so I
told him to get back home and sleep it off.
Then he got ugly. But I knew he was drunk
so I did not bother with him. Then he became
insistent and noisy and when he tried to punch
me I had to call in two soldiers. They took
him to the guardhouse. He was in there all
last night. This morning I let him out. I
think he is up at his cottage now, very much the
worse for his spree.”</p>

<p>“What a fine assistant I have!” said Mr.
Ryder sarcastically. “Tell Lyman to go and
rout him out. I want to talk with him.”</p>

<p>While the engineer and the operator were
talking, Captain Alvarez and his rurales arranged
their prisoners in line along the south
wall of the power station. This scene had
interested Jack far more than the recital of
Nedham’s drunken actions for it began to look
to the lad as if a wholesale slaughter was about
to take place.</p>

<p>“Heavens, I hope Captain Alvarez doesn’t
intend to execute them all,” said the youth to
Mr. Ryder when the day operator ceased talking.
“That would be hideous. It would be<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_209" id="Page_209">[209]</a></span>
brutal murder. You can’t countenance such
actions, Mr. Ryder?”</p>

<p>“Indeed I can’t,” said the engineer, hurrying
toward Captain Alvarez, “and besides I
want to have a word with Cerro before any
execution takes place. I think that man
knows some things that will help clear up the
mystery that surrounds all our recent
trouble.”</p>

<p>To do justice to the Mexican commander it
must be said that he had not intended to have
a wholesale execution. He explained this to
Mr. Ryder quite frankly and stated that he
merely intended to make the rebel leader face
the firing squad while his followers looked on.
He thought that it would be a capital way of
teaching a lesson. After the execution he purposed
sending the whole horde of prisoners to
Mexico City, where they would be turned over
to General Rodriguez to be confined in the
military prison.</p>

<p>“If it is all the same to you,” said Mr.
Ryder, “I would like to have a few words with
Cerro before he is shot.”</p>

<p>“Certain,” said the officer, “only et ez not<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_210" id="Page_210">[210]</a></span>
so easy to mek him to talk, he is ah what you
call—ah—to handle hard you know.”</p>

<p>The rebel leader was lying on the ground
near the entrance to the guardhouse. His
wounds had been bound up the evening before
by one of his followers, but in spite of all efforts
to ease him, it was quite evident that the
man was suffering a great deal.</p>

<p>Mr. Ryder bent over the prostrate form and
spoke in Spanish. “José Cerro, you are going
to die. You will soon face the firing squad.
Tell me who would give you three thousand
pesos for my capture.” But in spite of his
pain the little black-haired Mexican smiled
grimly and shook his head.</p>

<p>“No,” he said. “I cannot tell, no, no.”</p>

<p>Mr. Ryder was about to press his question
again, however, when Lyman appeared, leading
a very white and very nervous-looking individual
whom Jack recognized as Nedham.</p>

<p>“Here’s your assistant, Mr. Ryder; you said
you wanted to see him,” said Lyman.</p>

<p>But before the engineer could speak Nedham
caught sight of the man on the ground.
He shrank back in terror and gasped.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_211" id="Page_211">[211]</a></span></p>

<p>“Oh, it’s José Cerro!”</p>

<p>Mr. Ryder looked searchingly at his
trembling assistant, for he could not understand
what made the man so frightened at
seeing the wounded rebel leader. He did not
have long to speculate on the reason for such
strange actions, for Captain Alvarez came to
speak to him.</p>

<p>“You could no make José speak?” queried
the officer.</p>

<p>“No, he refused to answer my questions.”</p>

<p>“Ah-ha, did I not tell you zay all are so like
that.” Then turning to José Cerro, he said
in Spanish, “You are to die. Can you stand
up to face the firing squad or must we prop
you against the wall?”</p>

<p>“I shall die standing,” said the rebel
proudly, “and you shall not blindfold me
either.”</p>

<p>“All right, get up; we have not time to lose,
two others are to be shot after you. Perro,
our traitorous rurale, and his peon companion
die to-day,” said Captain Alvarez brutally.</p>

<p>“Carlos! Jesus! come, help your leader to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_212" id="Page_212">[212]</a></span>
rise; he must die standing,” called José Cerro
to two of the peon prisoners.</p>

<p>The faithful followers left their places and
raising the wounded man to his feet, assisted
him to the spot designated by the commander
of the firing squad. That his effort to walk
was causing the rebel excruciating pain was
evident from the expression on his face. It
took him some time to limp across the space
in front of the firing squad even with the help
of his men.</p>

<p>While he was taking his place before the five
executioners, a hush fell over the scores of
men that stood about. Every one was tense
and silent. José Cerro’s attendants shook
hands with him solemnly and left him standing
there alone. Slowly the five riflemen
brought their guns to position and took aim.
Then just as the officer was raising his sword
to give the firing signal, José Cerro spoke.</p>

<p>“A moment,” he said in Spanish, “just a
moment. I wish to speak—”</p>

<p>“No! No! Shoot! Shoot! Don’t let him
speak,” screamed a voice in English.</p>

<p>It was Nedham, trembling and on the point<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_213" id="Page_213">[213]</a></span>
of collapse. His face was distorted with fear
and he was forced to cling to Lyman to keep
from falling to the ground.</p>

<p>“So, Señor Nedham, you turn against me
now,” hissed the rebel leader. “You would
have me shot without speaking my last words.
You thought me a traitor who would tell your
plot. That was not intended. But now I
will tell. Come, Señor Ryder, listen. It was
Señor Nedham who plotted against you. He
it was who offered three thousand pesos for
your capture, I—I—was—.” The sentence
was cut off abruptly for the wounded man,
weak with the exertion of standing, suddenly
pitched forward on his face.</p>

<p>The rebel leader’s two loyal followers hurried
to his side to lift him back up on his feet,
but he was only semi-conscious and it was
evident to both that in a few moments more
the firing squad would be cheated of its
work.</p>

<p>In the meantime, Nedham, regaining some
of his shattered nerve, tried to bolt through the
crowd but Jack and Lyman seized him and
threw him to the ground.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_214" id="Page_214">[214]</a></span></p>

<p>“Hurry, Mr. Ryder, take off his left shoe,”
cried Jack. “I have an idea that this is the
man who stole your drawings and tried to
wreck the plant.”</p>

<p>The shoe and stocking were quickly removed
and much to the engineer’s amazement
a deep scar was revealed running diagonally
across Nedham’s heel.</p>

<p>“But—but—why I thought we had the man
with the scarred heel under arrest,” said Mr.
Ryder thoroughly mystified.</p>

<p>“Yes,” said Jack, “but it flashed upon me a
moment ago that the rurale’s scar was on his
right heel, while the scar mark in the dust was
on the left foot. Don’t you remember?
Here comes the rurale now, go look for yourself.”</p>

<p>Two men were leading Perro from the
guardhouse toward the firing squad. He was
still barefooted for no one had been considerate
enough of his comfort to return his cavalry
boots to him since his arrest.</p>

<p>“Let me see your left heel,” said Mr. Ryder
in Spanish, and obediently the rurale raised
his foot.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_215" id="Page_215">[215]</a></span></p>

<p>“By George, there’s no scar there! Is it on
the right foot? Let me see! But it was not
necessary for the rurale to raise his right foot
for the scar extended half way up the man’s
ankle and was plainly visible from the right
side.</p>

<p>“Well, this came near being a fatal mistake,”
exclaimed the engineer. Then to the
rurale in Spanish he said, “I’m glad to know
you’re not a traitor anyway, my man.”</p>

<p>And the Mexican grinned for he could see
by the expression on Mr. Ryder’s face that he
was not to be executed.</p>

<hr />

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_216" id="Page_216">[216]</a></span></p>

<h2 id="CHAPTER_XXI">CHAPTER XXI<br />
<span class="smaller">“YES, YES, I DID IT!”</span></h2>

<p>Nedham’s <i lang="es">pulque</i> drinking had completely
shattered his nerves and the effects
of the liquor combined with the revelation
of José Cerro had well nigh made a
physical wreck of the assistant engineer. Indeed,
as he stood in the center of the room in
Mr. Ryder’s cottage, where he had been
brought by Lyman and Captain Alvarez, he
swayed backward and forward, and if Jack
had not brought him a chair in all probability
he would have collapsed completely.</p>

<p>He looked at his inquisitors with staring
bloodshot eyes, and his fingers worked nervously
at the buttons on the front of his shirt.
His condition was pitiable and Jack and Mr.
Ryder both felt sincerely sorry for him.</p>

<p>“Nedham, where are those plans you stole<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_217" id="Page_217">[217]</a></span>
from my desk! You are the thief, aren’t
you?” demanded Mr. Ryder.</p>

<p>“Plans?” said Nedham, trying his best to
feign ignorance. “What plans? I—I—know—”</p>

<p>“Stop,” roared the engineer, “don’t lie, we
know you are the guilty man.”</p>

<p>“I tell you—I—I—Oh, God, yes, yes, I did
it! It’s true.” Nedham could control his
shattered nerves no longer. He broke down
completely. “I stole the plans! I stole them!
They are under the mattress of my bed!
They’ve been haunting me ever since I took
them! Curse the things! If I had had the
courage I’d have burned them long ago! I
did the rest too! I crippled the generators!
I smashed the searchlight! I offered the three
thousand pesos for your capture! I did it all—all—and
now, thank goodness, I’ve confessed!
It’s all over! The strain! The
strain! It was horrible! I had to get drunk—beastly
drunk.”</p>

<p>Thus he raved until he was almost completely
exhausted, and his physical self, unable
to bear the strain any longer, caved in completely.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_218" id="Page_218">[218]</a></span>
His head dropped forward on his
chest and his hands fell helplessly over the
arms of the chair. He was unconscious for
nearly a quarter of an hour and it was only by
administering violent restoratives that Jack
and the engineer managed to make the man
himself once more.</p>

<p>For some time the four sat staring at the
helpless engineer. Finally Mr. Ryder spoke.</p>

<p>“Why did you do this deviltry, Nedham?”
he asked with a trace of disappointment in his
voice.</p>

<p>“I—I—well I was ambitious—and—I guess
a little jealous of you too,” said Nedham
weakly. “You know you only beat me out by
two points in the competition for chief engineer
and—well—I couldn’t help feeling bitter
toward you. I wanted your job, and I
wanted it badly, and from the time you appointed
me your assistant I started to
scheme ways of getting you out.”</p>

<p>“But what good would all your plant-wrecking
have done? Why did you put sand in the
generators and disrupt the place in general?”
queried the engineer.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_219" id="Page_219">[219]</a></span></p>

<p>“Well, first off I hoped to frighten you into
resigning. I—I—thought perhaps when you
found you had traitors among the men at the
plant you might fear for your own safety and
resign, but when I learned how angry Huerta
grew with each new occurrence and how often
he called you on the telephone and raised the
devil with you I saw a new way of getting your
job. I concluded that if the trouble was kept
up long enough the President would dismiss
you entirely as an incompetent manager and
put me in charge. The day they called you
down to Mexico City and had you up before
the directors I felt mighty confident that you
would not last long.</p>

<p>“You brought this youngster back with you
and from then on my plans began to go wrong.
I saw you two pass the office the first night
Jack was here. I followed you into the generating
room and hid behind one of the machines.
I saw you sprinkle the cement dust
and I knew you were setting a trap. But as I
watched it suddenly occurred to me that you
were unconsciously giving me a capital opportunity
of throwing you off the trail entirely.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_220" id="Page_220">[220]</a></span>
Thereafter I decided to work with my feet
bared so that you would think a peon was
doing the damage. I forgot completely about
the scar on my heel until it was too late.”</p>

<p>“But the plans; the drawings of the lightning
arrester. How did you even know of
their existence? I kept my work on that appliance
very secret indeed,” interrupted Mr.
Ryder.</p>

<p>“Well, after I watched you set your trap I
followed you back to the cottage for I was
curious to hear what you might have to say
about the situation. I saw the bundle of
drawings drop from your shirt. Also I saw
where you put them. And although I did not
have the slightest idea what the plans were
about I decided that so long as I had gone that
far I might just as well take a look at your
private papers too. I thought perhaps they
were orders or instructions you had received
from Huerta that day.</p>

<p>“I waited until you were both sound asleep,
and slipped into the room and opened your
desk. It did not take me long to learn that
the papers were drawings of a lightning arrester<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_221" id="Page_221">[221]</a></span>
of a type I had never seen before. Then
it occurred to me that the appliance was one
of your own invention. I looked for patent
marks and could find none and on the impulse
of the moment I slipped the yellow envelope
into my pocket and went back to the plant. I
figured that I had made a double coup, for if
you were to build that lightning arrester and
install it here you would win the favor of
President Huerta and consequently my efforts
would all be wasted. Also I was dishonest
enough to think that perhaps I could easily
secure a patent on the appliance in my own
name when I finally got you out of the way.”</p>

<p>“Nedham! I never would believe it of you,”
said the engineer reproachfully.</p>

<p>“Don’t, don’t, please don’t reproach me,
Heaven only knows where my manhood has
gone to,” cried Nedham in agony.</p>

<p>“And do you mean to say that you deliberately
brought on battle and caused hundreds
of lives to be sacrificed merely to get me out of
my position?” asked Mr. Ryder incredulously.</p>

<p>“Yes, yes, I did. I offered José Cerro three
thousand pesos to get you out of the way. I<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_222" id="Page_222">[222]</a></span>
did not want you killed. No, no, I was not as
base as that. I merely wanted you captured
and kept a prisoner so long that when you
were finally released I would be safely intrenched
here and in the favor of the President
to such an extent that you could never regain
your position. José Cerro thought an attack
the only way to get you, and I smashed the
searchlight and did everything else to help
him. Oh, it was villainous work, I know.
Heaven forgive me, I must have been mad.”</p>

<p>The three Americans present were utterly
amazed at the man’s treachery, but Captain
Alvarez did not understand fully, for his
knowledge of English was so meager that he
could not follow the strange recital in every
detail. When the story was translated for his
benefit, however, his fiery temper became
aroused to such a pitch that the three Americans
could hardly restrain him from rushing
at the helpless assistant engineer and beating
him senseless with his fist.</p>

<p>“The dog! The traitor!” roared the Mexican
in Spanish. “<em>He</em> should be killed! <em>He</em>
should face the firing squad! Come, drag him<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_223" id="Page_223">[223]</a></span>
out! We will shoot him! We will shoot
him!”</p>

<p>“No! no!” shrieked Nedham, a look of horror
coming into his ashen face. “No! no! you
cannot kill me! You cannot shoot me! I am
an American citizen!”</p>

<p>“He is right,” said Mr. Ryder. “We cannot
execute him without bringing on international
complications that would be distasteful
to President Huerta. No, we can’t shoot him,
even though he does deserve it. But we can
expel him from the Republic of Mexico. Put
him in the guardhouse, Captain Alvarez, and
this afternoon we will ship him to Mexico City
with the rest of our prisoners. We can turn
him over to the authorities there and request
that he be sent out of the country immediately.”</p>

<p>A look of relief spread over Nedham’s face
when he heard Mr. Ryder’s opinion.</p>

<p>“Oh, never fear, I’m only too willing to be
quit of this country. I can’t see how any man
can keep straight in this hole of iniquity.”</p>

<p>“It was not a hole of iniquity until treacherous
villains of your stamp came into it,” retorted<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_224" id="Page_224">[224]</a></span>
Mr. Ryder. Then turning to Captain
Alvarez he said, “Call in your trooper and
have him taken to the guardhouse. The train
for Mexico City will be made up as soon as
possible. In the meantime you and Lyman
stay here and sample one of Tom Why’s excellent
dinners. Things have gone so far to
the devil lately that I haven’t had time to enjoy
a good dinner myself. After dinner I’ll accompany
you to Mexico City for I will have to
make a report of this whole matter to our directors.
I guess the plant will be safe enough
in the hands of my new assistant, Mr. Lyman.”</p>

<p>The night operator’s face beamed when he
heard, thus abruptly, of his promotion and he
blushed like a schoolboy when Jack and Captain
Alvarez congratulated him.</p>

<p>“I envy you,” said Jack Straw heartily, “for
there’s nothing I’d like more than to be connected
with a huge generating station like
this.”</p>

<p>“Well, we’ve room for a boy here, and we
could teach you a great deal about the electrical
industry. Why don’t you apply for a
position,” said Lyman meaningly, at the same<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_225" id="Page_225">[225]</a></span>
time glancing in the direction of Mr. Ryder.</p>

<p>“Oh, no,” said the lad from Vermont, “I’ve
already been away from Drueryville a month
and I think it is about time I hurried back. In
fact, I’ve decided to go in on the train this
afternoon with Mr. Ryder. Some day after
I have acquired a real training at ‘Sheff.’ or
some other engineering school I may visit
Necaxa again. Who knows?”</p>

<p>“Well, if we are still here you can be certain
of a welcome, my boy,” said Mr. Ryder
heartily.</p>

<hr />

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_226" id="Page_226">[226]</a></span></p>

<h2 id="CHAPTER_XXII">CHAPTER XXII<br />
<span class="smaller">GOOD-BY, NECAXA</span></h2>

<p>The string of flat cars and the snorting
steam engine were waiting when Jack,
Mr. Ryder, the new assistant engineer and
Captain Alvarez arrived. Indeed, the soldiers
and rurales were already hurrying their prisoners
aboard. Wicked-looking regulars were
stationed at each end of the cars and there appeared
to be small chance of any of the peons
escaping from the train during its journey toward
the capital.</p>

<p>In half an hour everything was ready.
Jack found that a large group of workmen had
gathered to see him depart and he shook hands
with each one of them before he finally swung
aboard the platform of the yellow caboose and
took his place beside Mr. Ryder and Captain
Alvarez. Slowly the little train gathered
headway and with the cheers of the men ringing<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_227" id="Page_227">[227]</a></span>
in his ears Jack Straw said good-by to
Necaxa. But the string of cars had scarcely
gone two hundred yards when a figure elbowed
its way through the crowd of workmen and
soldiers and came swinging down the narrow
track at a rapid pace. His shoulder was bandaged
about with white cloth and at his heels
followed a tawny, long-eared hound. It was
Miguel, the Indian runner, and his dog.</p>

<p>After some effort the agile messenger overtook
the train and jumped aboard the steps of
the caboose. Hastily he held out his hand toward
Jack and mumbled something in Spanish.
The lad from Vermont was greatly pleased
that the redman was so eager to say farewell
to him that he risked jumping aboard the moving
train, and he wrung the Indian’s hand
warmly.</p>

<p>“What did he say?” asked Jack of Mr. Ryder
when the messenger had swung to the ground.</p>

<p>“He said ‘I am still in debt to you for saving
my dog. Many thanks, many thanks,’”
replied Mr. Ryder.</p>

<p>“Well, it strikes me that he paid that debt
off several times during the last few days,”<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_228" id="Page_228">[228]</a></span>
laughed Jack as he waved to the Indian who
remained standing in the center of the track
watching the departing cars.</p>

<p>The news of the battle and the treachery of
Nedham at Necaxa reached the capital over
the long-distance telephone wire long before
the train with the prisoners arrived and when
Jack and Mr. Ryder entered the American
Hotel after Nedham and the rest of the prisoners
had been turned over to the proper authorities,
they found the evening papers
crowded with the news. Pictures of the prisoners
that had been brought in, pen sketches of
the battle and photographs of the plant at
Necaxa occupied the front page of the dailies
and scare headlines fairly shouted the details
attending the capture of José Cerro and his
band. Fortunately one of the papers printed
an American as well as a Mexican edition and
Jack was able to read the full account of his
own adventures.</p>

<p>The capture of José Cerro was the subject
of conversation in the dining-room of the hotel
that evening too, and many of Mr. Ryder’s
friends sought him out and congratulated him<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_229" id="Page_229">[229]</a></span>
on the successful way in which he had handled
things at Necaxa through all the trouble. Indeed,
after a time the publicity that they were
attracting became distasteful to the two Americans
and they made haste to finish their meal.</p>

<p>But just as they were leaving the dining-room
a tall sun tanned individual rushed up
and clapping Mr. Ryder on the shoulder fairly
shouted:</p>

<p>“Why, Harry Ryder, you old fighting
engineer, I am glad to see you alive after such
a mixup. And as I live here is my young
friend, Jack Straw.” Jack instantly recognized
the man as Mr. Warner, the marine
engineer whom he had met on board the <i>Yucatan</i>
on his way south to Vera Cruz. The lad
was more than pleased to see Mr. Warner once
more and shook hands cordially.</p>

<p>“Hello there, Jim Warner!” exclaimed Mr.
Ryder; “what the dickens are you doing down
in this part of the world?”</p>

<p>“Why, I’ve been tinkering with the old
Lobo’s Island Light for nearly a month. To
tell you the truth, I’ve just finished the job and
knowing that you were within a few hundred<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_230" id="Page_230">[230]</a></span>
miles of me I decided to run in to see you. I
was going out to Necaxa to-morrow and spend
a week or two with you, but unfortunately that
can’t be done for I’ve just received a telegram
from Washington instructing me to go ahead
with a mighty big undertaking I’ve been figuring
on. I’ll have to hustle back to the coast
immediately. And in view of the fact that you
have been having quite a fuss out there I’m
rather glad my plans have been changed. I’m
not hankering to be drilled through by a soft-nosed
bullet just now,” concluded Mr. Warner
with a smile.</p>

<p>“Oh! you would soon get used to those little
things,” said Jack banteringly.</p>

<p>“I suppose so,” replied the marine engineer.
“You must have had rather an adventurous
month there.”</p>

<p>“Indeed I did,” answered Jack.</p>

<p>“Well, how would you like to have another
month of thrills? If you feel inclined that
way, come along with me. If you don’t fight
men you’ll fight the elements. I am going to
cruise the high seas for Uncle Sam.”</p>

<p>“That sounds interesting,” said Jack, “but<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_231" id="Page_231">[231]</a></span>
I am going north on the next steamer from
Vera Cruz.”</p>

<p>“So am I, and we’ll get a chance to talk it
over anyway,” said Mr. Warner.</p>

intellectual property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or
other medium, a computer virus, or computer codes that damage or

<h3>Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm</h3>

<p>Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.</p>

<p>Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at
www.gutenberg.org.</p>

<h3>Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation</h3>

<p>Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.</p>

<p>The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular
state visit <a href="http://www.gutenberg.org/donate">www.gutenberg.org/donate</a>.</p>

<p>While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.</p>

<p>International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.</p>

<p>Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate</p>

<h3>Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works.</h3>

<p>Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg-tm concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.</p>

<p>Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.</p>

<p>Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search
facility: www.gutenberg.org</p>

<p>This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.</p>
